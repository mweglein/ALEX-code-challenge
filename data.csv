First Person Singular,"What's up? What's happening? What's new? How you been? How you doing? We say these things every time we meet a friend --and we really want to know. Readers of memoirs ask these or similar questions, and memoirists give us the answers -- beautifully. We're lucky that curious people have so many memoirs to choose from. And for the last several years we've had memoirs from all over the world, not just the United States. This First Year Seminar studies the contemporary memoir in a multicultural setting. Through the books we read, we travel to such places as Somalia, the Sudan, Egypt, and Cuba. Students write critical essays about the memoir in general and the books we read in particular. They also write their own short memoirs -- vignettes from their life. And students do research on the day they were born and complete an oral presentation on the findings. The course ends with students writing a final essay on what they think constitutes a good memoir.",FSEM 003
"Pin-Ups, Princesses and Femme Fatales: Women in American Popular Culture","This writing instructive class examines the relationship between women and popular culture in 20th century history.  Looking analytically at popular texts from a variety of media, including film, comics, and television we'll ask:  How is gender being represented and performed in pop culture?  What forms of pop culture have been specifically targeted at women?  How have women resisted or co-opted the messages they have received?  What kinds of fears or anxieties about women did pop culture elicit and how did Americans negotiate those anxieties?  The course takes an interdisciplinary perspective on the questions above using students own expertise as consumers of popular culture as an entryway for exploring the diverse roles mass-mediated popular culture has played in 20th century history.  In doing so, this class will be a space for critical engagement and dialogue regarding how forms of popular culture work and how we can become critical consumers of culture.",FSEM 004
"Stealing Art, Saving Art","What motivates people to collect art? What motivates people to steal art? What motivates rare individuals to fake art? In this FSEM, students look at the seamy underside and the high-minded public face of cultural property, and the art world, from Nazi looters to museum directors. Among the topics considered: the transition from the Indiana Jones era of archaeology to scientific excavation; Goering's art looting and contemporary art restitution processes' the role of art museums in the restoration, conservation, and exhibition of art; and the complicated business of art fraud and forgery.",FSEM 011
Banned and Burned: Censorship and the Arts,"What makes art beautiful to one person and obscene to another? In the 1971 Supreme Court case<em>Cohen v. California</em>, Justice John Marshall Harlan II famously wrote, ""one man's vulgarity is another's lyric."" This course will explore iconic instances of censorship in theatre, performance art, literature, and visual arts throughout the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. From the burning of books to the revocation of federal arts funding to recent cancellations of high school plays, we will study the ways in which the arts have become lightning rods of controversy. We will examine historical documents, legal proceedings, and activist responses in order to situate high-profile instances of arts censorship within their cultural context. How far is too far when it comes to aesthetic expression? Is there such a thing as ""too far"" in art and performance? What are the legal, ethical, and aesthetic ramifications of censorship in the arts??",FSEM 012
Why Are Some Countries Rich?,"Why are some countries rich while others remain poor? The answer matters because ""rich"" versus ""poor"" translates into significant differences in the quality of life of the ""average"" person in these countries. The history of the post-WWII period is littered with the corpses of ""big ideas"" that purported to answer this question and thus provide the key to growth. Colonial exploitation, low investment rates, inadequate spending on education, insufficient financial liberalization, among others, all failed to answer the question by themselves and certainly didn't provide the magic elixir for growth. We will examine the merits and the failings of these big ideas and consider some newer proposals as well. We'll particularly look at the roles of geography and of political, social and economic institutions and the incentives they create. There may be no single big idea that will work for every country, but we will identify some characteristics that clearly separate the ""poor"" from the ""not so poor."" ",FSEM 029
Interrogating Race in the United States and South Africa,"Do we live in a post-racial world or a new Jim Crow society? What are the legacies of slavery, segregation, and apartheid? What is meant by white privilege? How do we value human life and what are the ways of developing emancipatory movements? This course examines the parallel structures of segregation in the United States and apartheid in South Africa. The basic premise is that through the lens of another culture we can come to examine our own. The causes and effects of segregation and apartheid on contemporary race relations are the central focus. How race affects gender, class, and social spaces is explored throughout the readings.",FSEM 042
Bird Obsessions: Beauty of Beast,"We are a world obsessed with birds; bird watching is one of the most popular hobbies in the nation and bird enthusiasts spend thousands of dollars on equipment, bird feeders, and on vacations to catch a glimpse of unseen species. Conservationists advocate spending millions of dollars on saving and protecting birds, such as the ivory-billed woodpecker and the California condor, from extinction. Why are we so obsessed with birds? Is it their amazing ability to fly, their almost implausible migrations, their vibrant colors, their curious personalities? What do birds represent to us and other cultures? In some religions, birds have been invoked as symbols of peace, power, trickery, gluttony, and intelligence. Do the lives of birds really embody these anthropomorphic characteristics? Do birds represent hope for spring, for the environment, or for the future? In this course, we'll examine the lives of birds, the people who are obsessed with them, and their interactions from a variety of perspectives. We'll explore birds as models for conservation and science, as religious symbols, and as subjects of art and literature. You'll also have an opportunity to connect with the environment of the Finger Lake region by learning about and observing our local birds. ",FSEM 056
Tales of the Village Idiot,"In this course, students survey the wealth of Russian folk tales, epic songs, legends, riddles and other elements of the oral tradition as well as the later literature these genres inspired. Students examine characters such as the Firebird, Baba-Yaga the witch, Koshchei the Deathless and llya Muromets, and read many types of folktales, including magical, animal and ""idiot"" tales. Materials include art and music arising from the Russian folk tradition. Students also consider the role of folklore in contemporary American life, and the ways in which some genres continue to produce new examples of folklore.",FSEM 058
Thinking Critically about God,"The concept of God has shaped how billions of people have lived their lives. Different religions have different ideas about God, but there are some common themes, and many of them raise serious questions: If God is all-powerful, can he create a rock so heavy he cannot lift it? If God is all good, then why is there evil in the world? If God is all-knowing (including the future), then how can I have free will? We will examine these and many other tough questions by reading classic and contemporary writings. Students will engage in at least two structured classroom debates and will also write frequently about many challenging topics. This course is a rational inquiry into these issues that is open to everyone, regardless of their belief system. Please note: There will be several required films outside of regularly scheduled class times. ",FSEM 066
Sustainable Living and Learning,"We are all consumers. We buy things. We use things up. We throw things away. Often we do all of this without considering the life cycle of these ""things."" Think about all the t-shirts you own. Do you know what materials make up your t-shirts? Moreover, do you know what was required to get these t-shirts to you in the first place? While these questions may seem to have simple answers, the reality is that each of the ""things"" we consume has a complex secret life of its own, one worthy of further consideration. This course will explore the complex relationship between sustainability and consumption, paying specific attention to the myriad ways in which individual consumption practices shape global outcomes. ",FSEM 078
Knowing Bodies,"How do you live in your body? What choices do you make every day? ""Knowing Bodies"" is an introduction to claiming oneself through the education of the mind and body simultaneously. Students begin to explore the relationships between body and mind and how they project themselves to the world. Students learn to acknowledge their individuality while improving movement potential and self-expression  oral, written, and movement-based. Students become keen observers while learning about the structure and movement potential of the human body through movement explorations and hands-on techniques. They develop skills for improving movement facility and begin to acknowledge and understand conscious and unconscious behaviors. Students demonstrate self-identity and artistic expression through the creation of art collages and movement studies while becoming more effective communicators through journal writing, discussion, oral presentations and movement expression. ",FSEM 085
The History of Everything,"Did you know that it was not until 300,000 years after the ""big bang"" that light occurred, or that in the year 2000, the tenth largest economic entity in the world was Microsoft (Australia was thirteenth, to put things in prospective)? David Christian's Maps of Time is an example of a recent form of historiography called ""big history,"" because it attempts to locate human beings from the perspective of much larger contexts than the traditional historical periods. Christian's book begins nanoseconds after the ""big bang,"" describes the development of the universe, the formation of our planet, the origins and evolution of life, including human life, and continues to trace human history through the origins of agriculture, the development of cities, states, and civilizations, the development of world religions, etc., up to globalization and the modern world, and then it peeks into future. What this course will do is to give us the opportunity to orient and seek to understand ourselves in relation to a variety of contexts from the cosmic to the global to the national and the local, contexts which, as Christian's book shows us, no matter how vast, or distant, or alien they may seem, create the patterns that play an intimate role in shaping our lives.

"Golf Course Architecture: Literature, History and Theory","What is actually at play when someone plays golf? Game design theory suggests that golf is the occasion for a certain experience shaped by rules, actions and skills of the golfer, and the golf course itself. Unlike a basketball court, each golf course is unique, due to a deeply intentional design by a golf course architect. As Alister Mackenzie insists ""The essence of golf is variety."" We approach multiple questions: What are the basic elements of golf course architecture? How do golf course architects imagine the game of golf when they design and build a golf course? What kind of experience do they intend for the golfer? What impact have diverse people, male and female, black and white, rich and poor, who have played golf, had on the history of golf course design? What are the actual lived experiences of golfers, and how have they changed over time? We will pay special attention to the work of important architects who were active locally, and we will visit some of their amazing creations. (Note: Playing golf is not a requirement, and learning how to golf and learning how to design a golf course are not included in the syllabus.)",FSEM 105
The Culture of Respect,"Every community of human beings, every society around the world, is faced with the challenge of creating a culture where all individuals are respecting independently of their differences. This course studies both the differences and the common bonds that connect human beings to one another. Issues of gender, race, class, religion, and sexuality, among others, are studied historically and from multicultural perspectives. By studying the dynamics of oppression that result from the unequal access of power, money, information and education, and by listening to experiences and stories of hope, students develop tools to create a society in which all voices are heard. A theoretical framework for a deeper understanding of the dynamics of human oppression is provided. Yet, this course goes beyond theory to practice. In this light, the class is team-taught by faculty and students.",FSEM 107
From Comix to Graphix: The Art of Story,"Are comics and graphic novels literature, art, both, or neither?  What does Wonder Woman have to do with political history?  Why render the Holocaust in a comic format? This course surveys the history and development of comics and graphic novels, a thriving hybrid form.  Collaboratively taught by a literature professor and an art historian, the course will use methods of literary and visual analysis to gain a deeper understanding of graphic storytellings.  Students will read a range of works in these media, as well as theory, method, and criticism in the field.  Students will process critical analyses as well as creative projects, both individually and in collaboration.  This course helps students develop multiple skills of interpretation of narratives in a range of contexts.  Readings may include Persepolis, Maus, Fun Home, and Scott Pilgrim, among others.",FSEM 108
Creating: Myths &amp; Minds,"This course critically examines various perspectives on the nature of creative activity in the arts, sciences, and everyday life. Students read a wide range of both descriptive and theoretical literature (psychological, philosophical, historical, and sociological) while trying to articulate their own ideas on concepts such as creativity, creating, genius, intelligence, invention, and problem solving. The emphasis throughout is upon analyzing concepts of the creative in terms of actual creative experience. This course places a premium on student writing and student participation.",FSEM 118
Sustainable Communities,"This course introduces students to the concept of sustainable development as applied to real world communities. It will not only focus on the United Nation's three ""interdependent and mutually reinforcing pillars"" of sustainable development - economic development, social development, and environmental protection - but also will touch on intertwined subjects such as individual and collective responsibilities, community planning, and environmental justice. Case studies will be used to discern how individuals, cities, and towns are working to become more sustainable. (Lewis, Mauer, <em>offered annually</em>)",ENV 101
Sustainable Community Development Capstone,"This course applies the practices and processes of sustainable community development through a service-learning project with local organizations. The course will begin by surveying the myriad approaches to sustainable development methods and application undertaken by a variety of disciplines. Students will evaluate the successes and failures of not only the methods but the outcomes of these efforts in achieving social equity, environmental and economic sustainability. Through a service-learning project, students will navigate through the process of developing a sustainable community development plan by applying the skills and knowledge developed throughout the course. (Lewis/Mauer, <em>offered alternate years</em>)",ENV 351
Hunger,"In 1826 Brillat-Savarin wrote, ""Tell me what you eat and I will tell you what you are."" But what can we tell from studies of not eating? This course will explore the hungering of fasting ascetics, anorexic girls, medieval saints, crash dieters, occasional cannibals, professional athletes, TV contestants, strategic political fasters, and famine and environmental disaster victims among others. Our subject will be cravings, desires, uneasy sensations, and weakened conditions as occasioned by the lack of food or some other unmet need. We will examine the myriad ways that hunger is constructed cross-culturally to critically analyze what it means in relation to other features of daily life. Using multidisciplinary accounts such as fiction, history, ethnography, biography, and film, we will examine how in particular contexts what we gloss as hunger can inform larger issues, such as the relationship between the individual and society, society and culture, and the local and the global. ",FSEM 125
Country Music and the American Working Class,"Surveys suggest that country music is both loved and hated by more Americans than any other music genre.  These different attitudes are not simply a matter of individual taste.  They are tied to deep divisions in US society.  Traditionally, country music has been linked to the American working class, particularly to the parts of the working class seen as most traditional: poor rural whites from the South and Midwest.  It includes romanticized images of small town life and traditional values, but also stereotypical images of 'rednecks' and 'white trash'.  This class uses country music as a starting point for exploring such issues.  In what ways does country music reflect the realities of working class life?  In what ways does it distort or parody it?  And what cultural and political issues are at stake in how we imagine country music and working class people?",FSEM 128
I Know What You Ate Last Summer,"Chemistry is a fundamental component of home and restaurant food preparation, as cooking is ultimately a series of complex chemical reactions. Chemistry is also essential to the production of food, from the most basic ingredients to the most elaborate industrial grocery store offerings. An understanding of how society produces food, and how these practices are both regulated and manipulated, can be informed by an appreciation of the chemistry that underlies these techniques. Students in this course begin by garnering a background in food-related chemistry; they then apply this knowledge to the understanding of food production and policy. Students will design and perform experiments using food, research and write about issues of food production and policy, and learn to communicate their finding.",FSEM 130
Critiquing the Classroom," What does it mean to be college educated? What is a college education for?  Who belongs in our system of higher education?  From skyrocketing tuition fees to campus open carry laws to debates about what topics even belong in the classroom, there is much that threatens to destabilize the American college experience as we know it.  This course is designed to explore and challenge fundamental preconceptions of what it means to teach and learn in the context of higher education.  ""Critiquing the Classroom"" is about understanding your relationship to the complex political world of the higher education, and about starting to explore what you might accomplish here.  Topics will include: the politics of ""knowledge production"", sexism and racism on college campuses, the benefits and challenges of place-based learning, the influence of consumer culture on higher education, lessons from critical and feminist education , and the social geographies of campuses and classrooms.",FSEM 148
Comparative Mythodology,"This course is designed under the premise that understanding myth is an important step towards understanding ourselves and our diverse cultures. It is an invitation to recognize the mythic in our daily lives. For most students, ""mythology"" means Greek, Roman or Norse mythology. However, this course will go beyond these sources and will compare them to myths from Africa, the Americas, Oceania and Asia. Students will discover the fascinating parallels that exist among the myths of widely separated cultures; they will see how parallel myths narrow the gaps between cultures and reveal what is constant and universal in human experience. After an introduction about the meaning of ""myth"" in time, history and religions, the course will be structured around the comparative study of the main types of myths: creation myths, flood myths, love myths, morality myths, myths of the hero, journeys to the underworld, visions of Apocalypse and the tricksters' myths. A final section will explore interpretations of myths, the difference between myth and religion or science and the idea of the ""monomyth.""",FSEM 149
"Am I Crazy? Madness in History, Culture, and Science","Mad geniuses, crazy athletes, weird artists, political and religious fanatics, horror films, ghost stories, the confessions of loners, losers, and outcasts-all have to do with the distinction between that which is strange and that which is familiar, those who are similar to us and those who are different, those who are normal and those who are abnormal-in short, those who are ""crazy"" and those who are ""sane."" In this seminar, our aim will be to come to terms with what this curious and mercurial thing called ""madness"" is, as well as what it means-ethically and politically  to decide that someone is mad and someone else is not. Among other things, we will look at 1) how the definitions of madness and sanity have changed radically over the course of recorded history; 2) how these definitions often overlap with broader social and cultural definitions of normalcy, morality, health, fitness, and criminality, 3) how the discourse of madness often intersects with social and cultural attitudes towards gender, race, class, ethnicity, and sexuality. By reading texts from numerous disciplines (psychology, philosophy, medicine, science, history, fiction, drama, anthropology, sociology) as well as viewing a number of films and conducting our own preliminary research, we will explorevarying definitions of ""madness"" from a broad cultural and historical perspective, paying particular attention not only to the ways in which madness has been defined, but how different cultures and societies at different historical moments have celebrated, pathologized, or sought to ""cure"" the insane.",FSEM 157
Gentlemen Prefer Bombs and Drone On and On,"This is the era of ""fake news.""  It is the ""post-truth era.""  The inevitable question raised by the current state of news, information, and political messages is, "" How do we know what we know?""  This question is central to the study of how the media ( in all its forms ) influences how we make sense of ourselves, our society, and our public policies.",FSEM 184
Eat Like a Slav: Russian Food &amp; Culture,"Food: if we are lucky, we consume it three times a day.  But is it just something that keeps us going-- or is there more to it?  In this course, we will investigate the role that food plays in Russian culture from its earliest documented forms to the present day.  We will consider a variety of interdisciplinary contexts in which food takes a central role, including literature, economics, history, nutrition, and folklore, as well as the ways Russian food has been presented to the world at large.  We will examine the peasant diet, which for hundreds of years supported a massive political empire, as well as the luxurious habits of the upper classes, where Western European influences first took hold. Our work will find its practical application in a weekly kitchen laboratory session where we will construct these dishes as we discuss the nature of food in Russian culture of the last several hundred years.",FSEM 186
Moby-Dick,"<em>Moby-Dick</em> is not just an epic; it's also epically weird. The story about Ahab and the whale takes up just a small fraction of the text, while the rest of the book goes off in all directions, reflecting upon American history and culture, asking profound philosophical questions, examining the economics of the whaling industry, cataloguing the biology of whales themselves, waxing poetic about the symbolism of ""whiteness"" and ""blackness,"" and dozens of other things besides. In other words, the book contains multitudes, and because of this, it makes an excellent starting point for a liberal arts education. We will spend the semester reading <em>Moby-Dick</em> together, considering the novel from a variety of perspectives: everything from anthropology to zoology, with stops in history, literary criticism, political theory, film studies, environmental studies, and gender and sexuality studies along the way. Reading a book like <em>Moby-Dick</em> is in itself a significant accomplishment: coming to terms with The Whale will give you bragging rights for life. ",FSEM 191
Consuming News in a Culture of Entertainment,"Reporting and critically analyzing the news has never been more important to a free and open society, but there are serious threats to that fundamental cornerstone of our democracy. Which corporations own the majority of news outlets in the United States? What is the First Amendment and why does it impact every student at HWS? Why is investigative journalism one of the most exciting careers you can enter upon graduation? This course will introduce students to the fundamentals of journalism, and provide an historical perspective on how news has evolved into today's best and worst practices. Students will have opportunities to critically analyze their favorite news sources, including entertainment and sports news. Leading global news operations will also be introduced. There will be weekly news quizzes and students will be able to research and analyze a topic in media ethics in an essay assignment. Weekly news quizzes and student-produced mock news reports will also be a part of the course. Finally, be prepared to share interesting news with your classmates whether it is from a cell phone news application, twitter, or other source. ",FSEM 195
Introduction to Women's Studies,"This course introduces the vast, complex, changing field of women's studies. Students will be asked to become conversant with the history of feminism and women's movements (nationally and transnationally), to understand and theorize women and gender as categories of analysis, to think through differences that divide and unite, to reflect and move beyond individual experience and to connect feminism to everyday life. Students will be encouraged to raise their own questions about women, gender, feminism(s), modes of women's organizing, and the production of knowledge. While it is impossible to cover all pertinent topics in one semester, this course introduces various specific issues and histories that, taken together, highlight the complexity of Women's Studies as both scholarly endeavor and activist field. (<em>Offered each semester</em>)",WMST 100
Writer's Seminar,"This course is for students in any major who want to become successful as college writers. By honing skills in critical reading and thinking, students are introduced to analysis and argumentation in order to consider their ideas within the context of academic writing and their own lives. Students develop writing techniques through composing and revising narratives, analytical essays, and guided research projects. The course focuses on writing individually and in collaboration with peers, the instructor, and other student support (Writing Colleagues or CTL Writing Fellows) through an emphasis on the process of invention, drafting, and revision. Course times and themes vary with instructor.",WRRH 100
Page to Stage,"This course will teach students how to analyze and break down dramatic literature in order to create a blueprint for production choices. Students will engage in the close examination of literature in varied styles, regions, and historical periods from the points of view of theatre practitioners (actors, directors, and designers), learning diverse techniques of analysis in the process. These techniques include the study of plot structure, character analysis, internal and external actions, conflict, rhythm, and idea/theme. This course encourages students to consider the links between other periods and our own, and the ways in which detailed readings of dramatic literature inform the communicative and aesthetic power of the performed text. (May, Woodworth, <em>offered fall semesters</em>) ",THTR 100
Chicana Feminism and Visual Culture,"This course lays the foundations for the study of Chicana feminism, women of color feminism, feminist visual cultural studies, and arts-based activism. This course traces the emergence of Chicana as an identity category and its challenges to Chicano and feminist activism; the radical ways Chicanas have employed visual, performance, and graphic arts as a means of educating and catalyzing social change; and the rich body of indigenous folklore that has both defined gender and sexual roles and provided the platform for defying them. Throughout the semester, we will draw from primary texts from the beginning of the Chicano movement, a rich selection of visual, performance, and graphic arts, and contemporary scholarship in women's studies, Chicana/o studies, and visual cultural studies. (Martin-Baron, <em>offered alternate fall semesters</em>)",WMST 150
The Politics of Health,"This course takes an interdisciplinary approach to the critical study of health politics, including the politics of gender, race and sexuality. Through the themes of social and environmental justice, students will explore the uneven distribution of health care and wellness both within the United States and beyond. Topics include the history of the women's health movement, breast cancer awareness campaigns, reproductive health and technologies, HIV/AIDS, feminist psychology, eating disorders, environmental health and toxicity, and more. In exploring these topics, feminist theory will serve as a lens through which we examine different experiences of illness and disease. At the same time, feminist pedagogy will serve as the model upon which we build our policy recommendations. (Hayes-Conroy)",WMST 204
Gender and Geography,"As a point of entry to discussions of gender, place and culture, this course will explore the diverse ways in which geographers have conceived of, analyzed and redefined gender as a contested spatial practice. In particular, using contemporary geographic texts, we will explore the gendered dynamics of geographic research methods, nature discourse, resource management, embodiment and health, agriculture and food, and globalization, among other topics. Emphasis will be placed on recognizing and researching cultural difference across these various topical areas. Readings and class discussion will build through individual and group assignments toward a final research paper/presentation.",WMST 212
Multilingual Writer's Seminar,"This introductory English for Speakers of Other Languages course provides students with the opportunity to develop a foundational level of English literacy and communication skills. This course places an emphasis on writing in various genres including argumentation, narration, and summary, as well as various writing skills including cohesion, structure, grammatical fluency, and revision. Students will use their experiences at HWS to develop their English writing, reading, listening, and speaking skills, with priority being given to writing development. Students will improve their English skills through written responses to readings, essays written in multiple genres, and a presentation on an aspect in American culture or their home culture.

American Sign Language I,"In this introductory course, students learn basic ASL vocabulary and grammar as well as strategies for successful communication with the deaf. Instead of assuming a disability or medical model of deafness, this course presents the American Deaf Community as a linguistic minority and examines the complex relationship between language and identity. Students will develop an appreciation for the Deaf Community's contribution to the linguistic and cultural diversity of North America. They will consider the values and unique cultural characteristics of the Deaf Community in contrast to mainstream ""hearing"" cultural norms. Students learn about the historical context for the deaf experience in the United States from the early 19th century to the culmination of civil rights struggle with the passage of the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 through viewing documentaries like ""Through Deaf Eyes."" Films like ""Hear and Now"" introduce them to the controversy of cochlear implantation and its impact on deaf identity. Readings include ""Introduction to American Deaf Culture"" and ""A Journey Into the Deaf-World."" (Cappiello, <em>Fall, offered annually</em>)",WRRH 170
Acting I,"This course is designed to introduce the beginning student to the craft of acting through the use of improvisation, theatre games, and acting exercises. Actor training focuses on and makes use of individual and group exercises that challenge both the mind and the body. Emphasis is placed on developing concentration and focus, the use of the imagination, sensory awareness, and verbal and physical improvisational skills. Exercises are designed to encourage the acting student to listen to his or her impulses and to respond to them within the context of an imaginary circumstance. Students also learn to work off of a partner in order to discover their own true and authentic responses to another person. This course is a prerequisite for Acting II.

Students will be introduced to the theoretical issues surrounding the writing of history as well as research practices and opportunities in the field of theatre history. Students will interpret salient dramatic and theoretical texts and illustrate the ways in which these texts connect to the making of theatre as well as the ways in which theatre shapes and reflects larger culture(s). Over the course of the semester, students will explore pivotal moments in theatre history including Ancient Greece and Rome, Medieval Europe, Classical India, Yuan China, Early Modern England, Renaissance Italy, Neoclassical France, the Spanish golden Age, and Restoration England. Students will engage with historic material in a wide array of modes including research, performance, and design. (Woodworth, <em>Fall, offered alternate years</em>)",THTR 220
Stage Management,"In his seminal book <em>The Back Stage Guide to Stage Management</em>, Thomas A. Kelly describes stage managers as ""responsible and adaptable communicators who have the ability to handle and coordinate diverse groups of artistic personalities with tactful discipline and a sense of humor. They establish a creative environment by combining the ability to prioritize and anticipate and solve problems, with calm sensitivity and grace under pressure. Their ability to do the above stems from organizational ability, acquired technical knowledge..., familiarity with union requirements, and an inspirational personality that creates positive energy."" This class examines the way in which stage managers fulfill these wide-ranging duties, studying the process of stage management from pre-production to closing night. Stage Management emphasizes practical knowledge and skill development, through case studies, generation of a prompt book for a hypothetical production, and guest lectures with professionals in the field.

The Body Politic,"To inquire into ""The body politic"" is to inquire into the riddle of the relationship between the corporeal body and the social, political, economic, and environmental body. It is to ask oneself where one's own body begins and ends - does skin mark the boundary of the bodies? If so, what differentiates bodies such that some bodies are at the heart of political battles over rights and freedoms (including waging war in the name of women's bodies and access to reproductive rights or queer rights to love freely)? How is the idea of gender equality invoked to index non-violence and peace, economic well-being, or freedom? How do gendered bodies become the site of social and personal struggle? How do different traditions of thought and belief depict bodies? Do these different views carry consequences for how we inhabit our bodies and/or distinguish ourselves from animals? This course seeks to address some of these questions through theory, history, literature, film, guest speakers and movement - walking, dancing, and yoga - of the body. (Bayer)",WMST 220
American Sign Language II,"This course continues to develop the linguistic and cultural concepts introduced in ASL I. Students will expand their ASL vocabulary and incorporate greater use of the linguistic features unique to signed languages. Varied sentence structures are explored and encouraged.

Theatre For Social Change,"Due to the intimate and immediate relationship between theatre practitioners and audiences, theatre has been employed as a means of encouraging social action since the beginning of its history. As far back as 411 BCE, Aristophanes used the City Dionysia to reach massive and influential audiences with his anti-war play Lysistrata. Although contemporary theatre is typically associated with commercial success stories such as those on Broadway, the tradition of using theatre to inspire social change continues across the world, often outside of mainstream theatre spaces and in places as diverse as corporate boardrooms and city street corners. This course will introduce students to a variety of movements, practitioners, and approaches to creating theatre that encourage communities to work outside of dominant (and often violent/repressive) structures to instigate social change. Although such work has happened through critical stagings of classical texts such as Lysistrata, this course will emphasize the work being done by those who put the primary emphasis on social justice, with a secondary concentration on theatre  in other words, those who see theatre specifically as a vehicle for social change and alter their craft in order to best service this goal. Theatre for Social Change will combine traditional academic approaches (reading, writing, etc.) with the practical experience of collaborating together to create a short piece of theatre meant to provoke social change in the HWS and/or Geneva communities. In keeping with the democratic spirit of theatre for social change, in which all participants are viewed as bringing something to the table, no performance experience is required for this course.

Performing Arts in Balinese Culture,"This course will be a three-week intensive exploration into the rich performing arts tradition of Bali, Indonesia. Students will be immersed in various aspects of Balinese performing arts including Dance, Masked Performance, Traditional Instrument Performance, Shadow Puppetry, and Mask Carving. Courses will be taught alongside master artists at a professional performing arts conservatory in Depansar, Bali. This conservatory will serve us particularly well due to their mission to uphold the ways of traditional Balinese performing arts rather than what is becoming a more tourist-centric morphing of many of the traditional forms. Studio work will be supplemented with attendance at profession productions of different Balinese performing arts, allowing students to see what they are studying at a professional level and allowing them to learn and experience how ingrained the performing arts are in other aspects of Balinese culture. Planned excursions will also take us to visit various crafts-people throughout the region, allowing us to see how Balinese instruments, masks, and puppets are made.

Feminist Theatre,"This course will survey twentieth and twenty-first century British and American feminist theatre, focusing on performance texts that address salient concerns of first, second, and third wave feminisms, as well as performance modes that trouble such designations. Specifically, this course will examine the oft-marginalized role of women in mainstream commercial theatre both historically and within contemporary contexts. It will also explore the ways in which feminist theatre practitioners work in coalition with other social justice movements such as suffrage, workers rights, civil rights, and LGBT rights to create works that resist and/or redefine historically misogynistic modes of performance. The course will explore the ways in which notions of corporeality, intersectionality, poststructuralism, performativity and the gaze have shaped feminist performance traditions.

African American Theatre,"The legacy of African Americans in theatre in the United States is rarely acknowledged due to cultural amnesia and the predominance of white voices in all fields of theatre, journalism, and scholarship. This course seeks to introduce students to the diverse range of African American voices in the theatre throughout U.S. history. Although the course will briefly contextualize African American productions within the dominant culture's performance traditions (such as minstrelsy) in order to better understand the profound challenges facing black artists, the overwhelming area of study will be black authors, practitioners, and theorists from the 1900s to the present day.

Psychology of Women,"To Freud's question of ""What do women want?"" psychology has brought description, analysis, categorization and diagnosis in its effort to plumb the depths of woman's purported enigmatic nature. Parallel to psychology's mainstream versions are feminist writings exploring alternative views of psychological issues and life events. This course examines these parallel paths from early case studies of hysteria through to mid-century depictions of the ""problem with no name"" (Friedan) and to late 20th-century renderings of PMS, bodily dissatisfactions and eating disorders, and affect theories, such as happiness.

Whether we are reading Roger Angell's description of a baseball, considering a one-eyed matador, watching a high school girls' softball team, or contemplating a one-armed quarterback, we immerse ourselves and our readers in making sense of the world. We explore such questions as, Why are sports so deeply imbedded in our culture? What are the ethics of sport? How do sports disenfranchise certain populations? To answer these and other questions, students keep journals, write weekly sports features, and produce a mid-term and final portfolio.",WRRH 219

Literary Journalism,"Literary journalism blends factual reporting with narrative and stylistic strategies common in literature. Literary journalists are bound by many of the same standards as other reporters, but they have the additional goal, as Ben Yagoda puts it, of ""making facts dance."" The literary journalist might, therefore, suppress direct quotation - a staple of traditional journalism - in favor of scene and dialogue. Or, rather than withdrawing the writer's point of view to achieve objectivity, the story might foreground the reporter's voice and experiences. This course will explore specific ways in which journalism benefits from literary techniques. Our approach will be twofold: We will examine the genre historically, and we will critique student work during regular workshops. Although we will begin by identifying the genre's roots in the 18th and 19th centuries (including works by Defoe, Boswell, Dickens), we will spend the bulk of the semester steeped in 20th century and present-day practices. ""New Journalism"" (including works by Capote, Mailer, Didion, Thompson, Wolfe) will be a cornerstone of our study, as will today's cutting-edge practitioners (such as Coates, Beard, Rankine, and Wallace). Students will both emulate and resist these writers in their own work. (Babbitt)",WRRH 327

The TRIAS resident will meet with the class several times and serve as the contest judge.  Students will work in small groups to pitch one of  the finalist manuscripts to the judge.  By engaging in the book publishing and acquisitions process, students will grapple with such questions as:  How do lyric essays and hybrid texts work in conjunction with one another in a book-length manuscript?  What makes a creative manuscript good and how do we weigh it against competing manuscripts with different strengths?  And how can we distinguish between manuscripts that cross the threshold into the realm of literary excellence and those that do not?",ENG 324
The Lyric Essay,"HWS is the birthplace of the lyric essay. It was in the introduction to the Fall 1997 issue of Seneca Review that esteemed HWS professor Deborah Tall and Hobart alumnus John DAgata gave the lyric essay its most seminal and enduring definition, which begins by characterizing the new hybrid form as ""a fascinating sub-genre that straddles the essay and the lyric poem give[s] primacy to artfulness over the conveying of information [and] forsake[s] narrative line, discursive logic, and the art of persuasion in favor of idiosyncratic meditation."" We will begin our course examining the essays of Tall, DAgata, and writers published in Seneca Review. And in order to gain an appreciation of the lyric essay as an inherently innovative, ever-evolving, genre-busting art form, we will proceed to study a wide range of essayists. To enrich our on-going discussion, we will also occasionally incorporate key progenitors such as Montaigne and theorists such as Deleuze &amp; Guattari, Derrida, and Wittgenstein.

History of Western Art Music: Baroque and Classical (1600-1800),"From the early operas of Monteverdi to the oratorios of Handel and the cantatas of Bach, the Baroque composer aimed to ""affect"" his listener through powerful musical contrasts and rhetorical passions; Haydn, Mozart, and the young Beethoven, on the other hand, were more interested in projecting formal logic and proportional design in their sonatas, string quartets, symphonies, and other instrumental works. The course surveys tradition and change in Baroque and classical music and is based on selected readings, recordings, and scores. (<em>Offered every third semester</em>)",MUS 203
History of Western Art Music:</strong> <strong>Romantic and Modern (1800-1950),"Most 19th century composers pushed the expressive power of chromatic harmony and thematic unity to the musical extreme. By 1910, most of the musical avant-garde no longer found it possible to work within the constraints of the three century old tonal system. New systems and searches for novel sonorities led to the use of natural and electronically generated sounds. Chance happenings were advocated by composers who objected to older music's predictability. The course surveys tradition and change in romantic and modern music and is based on selected readings, recordings, and scores. (<em>Offered every third semester</em>)",MUS 204

Prerequisite: MUS 320 or permission of the instructor. (<em>Offered annually</em>)",MUS 420
Ottoman Worlds,"The modern Middle East as it is configured today is the byproduct of the particular circumstances and set of governing practices that characterized the Ottoman Empire. Far from a medieval monolith, this was an adaptive, modernizing empire that switched together peoples of different languages, religions, ethnicities, and political commitments. Yet well before it was formally dissolved in the defeat of the First World War, the coherence of Ottoman rule was disintegrating along its periphery. This course maps both the construction and disintegration of the empire, showing how both jointly made the network of states that replaced it. As an interdisciplinary course drawing from the humanities and social sciences, the course asks students to map and critically understand a variety of cultures of resistance through which Ottoman subjects worked to fashion their lives and their empire.

Among the kinds of problems considered in this course are: Is it always wrong to break the law? Can we prove God's existence? What is 'personal identity'? What distinguishes knowledge from mere belief? (Staff, <em>offered every semester</em>)",PHIL 100
Introduction to American Politics,"This course examines the capability of the American political system to respond to the needs of all its citizens. It looks at historical origins, basic institutions, distribution of power, popular influence, political parties, social movements, the relationship of capitalism to democracy, and inequalities based on class, race, and gender. (Deutchman, Lucas, Mink, Passavant, Rose, <em>offered each semester; subfield: AMER</em>)",POL 110
Introduction to Media and Society,"This course provides an introduction to various media and their modes, methods, and themes. We will explore the role of the media in shaping social consciousness, global economies, and material culture. Examples drawn from film, television, print media, and digital environments will be contextualized, analyzed, and theorized as crucial elements of our media culture. Students will gain an appreciation for the social, cultural, economic, and political influences of global communications while performing close readings of conventional media objects. Writing assignments, exams, and projects will help to cement insights gained through close investigation of films, TV shows, advertisements, video games, music videos, and more. (Staff, <em>offered each semester</em>)",MDSC 100
Puzzles and Paradoxes,"Puzzles can be both fun and frustrating. In some places, working to solve them can also provide fascinating insights about our world. Philosophical puzzles and paradoxes are like that. This course will cover a variety of challenging puzzles about the nature of reality, morality, language and what we can know about the world. Some of these puzzles have been solved, but many are not yet solved, and we can learn much from both of these. Even if you don't solve a particular puzzle completely, working toward the answer can help you with future problems by giving you a set of tools that you can use again and again to get other answers. Puzzles and paradoxes make you a better thinker. (And, for some, they are lots of fun too.)",PHIL 110
Contemporary Issues: Crime and Punishment,"This course explores the relationship between moral responsibility and criminal responsibility. It looks at some perennial problems in ethical theory, such as: What makes an act wrong? When is a person morally responsible for their actions? When is punishment an appropriate response to behavior that violates social norms? It also looks at some problems in legal theory and in public policy, such as: What sorts of acts ought to be criminal? When is a person legally responsible for her actions? Why should insanity be a defense to criminal charges? The following general question links all these problems: Which forms of behavior control are morally justifiable responses to which forms of social deviance? (Brophy, <em>offered annually</em>)",PHIL 151
Contemporary Issues: Environmental Ethics,This course explores the ethical and philosophical issues that arise when we consider the relation between humans and the natural environment - issues made urgent by our current environmental crisis. Among questions examined are: Is the value of nature intrinsic or only instrumental? Do humans have obligations toward nonhuman animals? Why are animal species worth preserving? Is it individual animals or ecosystems that should be of moral concern? What can feminism tell us about our treatment of nature? Are economic efficiency and cost/benefit analysis adequate criteria for assessing our relation to the environment? ,PHIL 154
Contemporary Issues: Morality and War,"This course explores the phenomenon of war from a moral point of view. Among the questions considered are: When, if ever, is it morally justified to fight a war? What, if any, are the moral limits on how one may fight a war? Among the topics considered are: just war theory, pacifism, realism, humanitarian intervention, civil war, terrorism, and nuclear deterrence. (Lee, <em>offered annually</em>)",PHIL 155
Biomedical Ethics,"This course examines ethical issues that arise in the practice of medicine, in the delivery of health care, and in biomedical research. Ethical issues arise in all areas of human activity, but they arise in medicine with special urgency. Some reasons for this are the special nature of the physician/patient relationship, the importance of the matters of life and death involved, the difficulty in distributing health care in a just manner, and the many recent technological advances in medical treatment that exacerbate all of these problems. Among the issues considered are informed consent, patient autonomy, confidentiality and privacy, genetic intervention, medical experimentation, reproductive control, allocation of scarce medical resources, and justice in health care delivery. (Staff, <em>offered annually</em>)",PHIL 156
Ethical Inquiry: Multicultural Approach,"This course considers some specific ethical issues from global and multicultural perspectives. Topics include issues such as human rights, gender roles and morality, world hunger and poverty, euthanasia, and racial and ethnic discrimination. In addition to examining these issues using a variety of Western philosophical traditions, students consider approaches that come from Chinese, African, Indian, Native American, feminist, Buddhist, and other non-Western perspectives. (Oberbrunner, <em>offered alternate years</em>)",PHIL 157
Debating Public Policy,"Effectively advocating for one's plan of action, when it's opposed, is what makes the difference between just a cool idea and an implemented policy. However, respectfully and persuasively selling one's ideas requires knowledge and skills that most people lack. This course develops students' theoretical knowledge of policy analysis tools and their practical skills (especially oral communication skills) to improve their advocacy. Students work in teams to develop public policy positions on current political, moral, and legal issues - domestic and international. Teams then formally debate these positions while other students vote on them. Strong emphasis is placed on anticipating problems with one's own public policy positions. Students learn about the general structure and tools of advocacy and opposition, as well as particular issues of current concern. The primary goal of this course is not to teach you how to debate. Debate is just the primary medium of the assignments about public policy analysis. (Barnes, <em>offered alternate years</em>)",PHIL 158
Ethics Civic Engagement,"How can I participate in my community in an ethical manner, and what can we, as a community, do to promote responsible civic engagement? Students will study traditional ethical theories and learn how to apply them to the many complex ethical questions facing individuals who engage in volunteering, service, civic engagement, and community activism. We will also address contemporary analyses of the ethical challenges posed by social inequalities of gender, race, sexuality, and class. Topics explored in this course include: professionalism, confidentiality, respect for autonomy, conflict of interest, appreciation of difference, trust and honesty. Students will learn ethical and non-oppressive strategies for engaging with both local and international communities. This course is a service-learning course with a civic engagement component. (K. Frost-Arnold, <em>offered alternate years</em>)",PHIL 162
Introduction Comparative World Politics,"An ambitious introductory course, aimed at teaching students basic theoretical and empirical concepts necessary for comparison across the world's political systems. Student will be introduced to the fundamental tenets of diverse political and economic systems and ideologies, explore the foundations of political order and disorder (including discussions of nationalism, state-building, globalization, revolution, and more), and consider the myriad ways in which relationships between state, society, and market are ordered. Theoretical discussions will be supplemented with empirical case studies from around the world. Combining theoretical insights with political, social, and economic history and current events will help students as they endeavor to understand just why it is that the world's political systems are organized the way they are.

Introduction to Political Theory,"This course reads classical political theory from the Ancient Greeks through the early modern period in England. The class introduces students to some of the major themes through which politics and political life have been understood. Beginning with Thucydides, it examines the virtues and values of the ancient world with attention to the dilemma between justice and expediency. Continuing with Plato and Aristotle, it considers justice, reason, and the good in the context of life in the polis. The course ends with the challenges Machiavelli's and Hobbes' notions of power present for the presumption of an original human sociality, for the emergence of liberal ideals of individual autonomy and national sovereignty. (Dean, <em>offered annually; subfield: TH</em>)",POL 160
Introduction to Feminist Theory,"What is feminism? This course looks at feminism in terms of its politics. How does feminism understand and analyze power? What political arrangements do feminists advocate? How do feminists imagine political change? We will focus our inquiry on three sites: university, work, and culture. In what ways have these sites been depicted in terms of violence and vulnerability? What sorts of power do such depictions undermine or support? In asking these and other questions, we will consider the relation between the critical investigations enabled by each site and the political changes such investigations mobilize. Authors include Judith Butler, Shulamith Firestone, Jack Halberstam, Maria Mies, Bernice Johnson Reagon, Kathi Weeks and others. (Dean, <em>offered occasionally; subfield: TH</em>)",POL 175
Introduction to International Relations,"As a broad introduction to the study of international relations (IR), this course is designed to give students an understanding of the basic concepts of world politics, an appreciation of the evolution of the current state systems, and interrogation of social forces such as race and gender, and a sampling of various approaches and theories of IR. Readings come from primary documents, as well as a standard text. The course is grounded in an awareness of current events. Students examine how the lens used to view the world shapes understanding of the world, its problems, and possible solutions. (Dunn, Yadav, <em>offered every semester; subfield: IR</em>)",POL 180
Modern American Conservatism,"One of the most significant factors in American politics over the last 40 years has been the rise of the Right in the United States. Although there has long been a tradition of an active Right in the U.S., it was for the most part politically marginalized. Over the last 25 years it has been increasingly successful and influential. This is especially true for the Religious Right or Christian Right. What happens to the post-William Buckley, post-Ronald Reagan Right will be a major focus of this course. (Deutchman, <em>offered annually; subfield: AMER</em>)",POL 204
Governing Through Crime,"For over thirty years, the United States experienced an exponential rise in both the numbers of people incarcerated and the rate of incarceration. The United States became comparable, in terms of the percentage of the population imprisoned, with the Soviet gulag or apartheid South Africa. Until the 1970s, criminal justice policy was seen as the domain of policy experts, while courts increasingly sought to protect the due process rights of those accused of crimes. At the end of this era the administration of the death penalty was declared unconstitutional and considered to be anachronistic, if not barbaric. Then something changed. The United States became a society that governed through crime. Today, some are becoming more reflective about the costs and consequences of governing through crime. Is something changing again?

Gender and Politics in the Middle East and North Africa,"This course will provide an overview of the politics of gender in the contemporary Middle East and North Africa, including the Arab countries, Iran, Israel, and Turkey. Topics covered will include women's engagement in revolutions, political parties, monarchical government, and resistance movements; state intervention into questions of gender, including family law, inheritance and citizenship rights, dress codes, laws regulating sexuality, and state feminism; and women's and feminist movements, including peace movements, Islamist feminisms, pro-democracy activism, and diasporic feminism. In particular, it will analyze recent and current revolutionary transformations in the Middle East and North Africa, in light of the ways that gender intersects with them. (Philbrick Yadav, <em>offered alternate years; subfield: COMP</em>)",POL 208
Visions of the City,"This course examines the changing and contested meaning of urban life in the United States. Cities have been cast as disordered spaces that corrupt our most fundamental attachments. But cities have also been presented as well-ordered cosmopolitan spaces in which the American experience could be almost perfectly expressed. In interrogating the tension between these two depictions of urban life, we will specifically discuss: attempts to inform daily practices through the design of the city; anxieties about immigration and mobility; architecture's relationship to nature and democracy; the origins of housing reform and urban planning movement; and the significance of gender, race, and class in the American experience.

"Body Moves: Photography, Film, Music Videos and Protests","From the bodies executing everyday tasks in early motion photography to the protesting bodies of Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter, this course will explore how moving bodies in the media have altered our perception of the modern world. We will consider the impact of the moving body and its media representations on gender, race, class, and globalization. We will study, for instance, pop star Beyonce Knowles video Formation in relation to the body politics of surveillance. We will also consider how tracking systems visualize the body, especially the immigrant body, as it moves through space and between places. This course emphasizes the relationship between theory and practice. Therefore, students will have the opportunity to create digital collages, Google, earth maps, and short iPhone films. No previous experience with media production required.",MDSC 140
Cultures of Advertising,"Advertising is among the most pervasive forms of cultural representation in our global society. In this course, we approach advertisements as economic, aesthetic, and ideological forces whose analysis reveals crucial information about cultural attitudes and ideologies of their time and place. We will study the industrial and aesthetic history of advertising by analyzing advertising campaigns as well as their strategies, themes, and practices. Our materials will be drawn from both corporate and non-profit campaigns, global and local campaigns, and from anti-consumerist actions and other resistant practices. Our work will cover diverse media, including: print culture, television, film trailers, mobile marketing, social networking sites, and new media branding and marketing campaigns.

History of Television,"An in-depth look at television history, from TV's theoretical beginnings to its current incarnation as a turbulent mirror for ""reality,"" this course critically examines television texts and criticism of the medium as entertainment, and as a contested force in social and cultural practices. Students consider significant technical and aesthetic shifts in programming, and arguments about the negotiation of race, ethnicity, class, and gender in TV. While some attention is paid to other national industries, the chief focus of the course is on television in the United States and western hemisphere. (Staff)",MDSC 203
Dance on Film,"This course provides an overview of the more than one hundred year long relationship between dance and video technologies. From Hollywood films like Singin' in the Rain and Dirty Dancing to experimental dance films by contemporary multimedia choreographers William Forsythe and Bill T. Jones, we will investigate how dance has long served as a topic of inspiration for Filmmakers, and how film challenges the ephemerality of dance. We will consider dance film with regard to gender, race, place, culture, labor, and politics. This course emphasizes the relationship between theory and practice. Therefore, students will write short papers on a variety of screendance works and have an opportunity to create a dance on film. No previous experience with media production or choreography is required.",MDSC 207
Script to Screen,"This course will focus on the elements of visual storytelling that lead from the words on the page to the moving image on the screen, or from the concept to the print ad or commercial. (Jimenez, <em>offered alternate years</em>)",MDSC 206
History of the Social Documentary,"Photography and moving images have been used to enlighten those who do not suffer to the lives of those who do, to forward social change, and to influence social policy, sometimes progressively and sometimes not. This course examines visual social documentary's influence, largely confined to consideration of American social documentarians, including influence of photographers of immigrants' conditions in major cities during the early 20th century; government-sponsored documentation of rural Americans' lives during the Great Depression; and documentary films which have shaped social conscience from consciousness. (Robertson, <em>offered alternate years</em>)",MDSC 303
Media and Theory,"This course provides an in-depth study of media forms and their modes, methods, and themes. We will explore the role of media in shaping social consciousness, material culture, and the experience of modern life. We will survey key theoretical works in media studies and cultural studies by reading them along with primary documents such as film texts, radio broadcasts, television programs, magazine and newspaper articles, soundtracks, digital environments, and more. Consumer attitudes, narrative forms, artistic practices, and modes of production will be investigated for their ideological underpinnings.",MDSC 304
Film Editing I,"This course offers an introduction to the art of film editing, with an emphasis on the practical aspects of editing. Students learn basic editing techniques for narrative and documentary film, using an industry standard NLE. In addition to actual editing exercises using unedited rushes or dailies, students study film sequences to learn various editing styles and techniques. (Jimnez, <em>offered annually</em>)",MDSC 305
Medicine and Society,"The worlds of media and medicine exist in a unique symbiosis. Not only do medical issues fuel plot lines of popular television programs and films, the creation of cable channels devoted to health care matters, an ever-increasing number of books, newspaper stories, magazine articles, advertisements, and Internet sites, but these media outlets, in turn, alter the practice and delivery of health care in the U.S. The intricate web conjoining the culture of medicine and the production of media has become a pervasive, two-way process that reflects the public's obsession with health care and the central role it occupies in our national consciousness. This class explores the interconnections between medicine and the media, investigating this collaborative enterprise that characterizes contemporary American society. (Friedman, <em>offered annually</em>)",MDSC 307
Cinematic Effects,"This course is an introduction to special effects and motion graphics. Using industry-standard compositing software (After Effects), students will learn basic compositing techniques, such as green screen, rotoscoping and matchmoving, within the context of the history and art of visual effects. Since its inception, film has been drawn to the possibility of altering reality through visual effects in the works of Gorges Melies; with the advent of digital compositing, special effects have gained added importance in contemporary filmmaking. Moreover, visual effect as 'staged' reality go beyond film to encompass the function of illusionism in Western representation as shown by Norman Klein in ""the Vatican to Vegas: A History of Special Affects."" Prerequisite: MDSC 305. (Jimenez, <em>offered annually</em>)",MDSC 308
Semiotics,"This is an introductory course to semiotics, the doctrine of sign in all forms and shapes. Signs are processes of interpretation. Anything (object, idea, feeling, action) can become a sign by being interpreted. But interpretation is itself a sign in need of being interpreted, and so semiotics quickly becomes a labyrinth in which the concept of the sign becomes more, rather than less, problematic, as the inquiry into its nature proceeds. A wide variety of approaches to semiotics are presented, and applications to literature, art, architecture, dance, history, anthropology, film studies, women studies, photography, sociology, psychology, and biology are encouraged.

Aesthetics,"This course addresses a variety of philosophical issues relating to the arts, focusing on questions such as these: What is the nature of artistic creativity? What is the purpose of the arts? Is there a way for us to determine aesthetic value? Is there truth in art? How are emotions related to the arts? What role should art critics play? How are interpretations and evaluations of art influenced by factors such as culture, time period, race, gender, class? What role do the arts have in non-Western cultures? Are there aesthetic experiences outside of the arts? The course concludes by examining specific art forms chosen according to student interests. (Oberbrunner, <em>offered annually</em>)",PHIL 230
Cosmopolitanism and Global Ethics,"Cosmopolitanism, deriving from the Greek 'cosmo' (world) and 'polites' (citizen), is the study of citizenship beyond the boundaries of nation-states. In this course, we will study theories of world-citizenship and the relationship of citizenship to global ethical questions. We will look, in particular, at two sorts of composition: ethical and political. Ethical cosmopolitanism concerns the ethical obligations we have to individuals with whom we do not share a nation-state. Political cosmopolitanism concerns development of global institutions to govern political or economic policies and laws that have global impact. Of primary importance in this course is the question of whether citizenship creates special moral and political obligations. We will consider the idea of world citizenship with regard to international organizations and global governance, human rights, immigration, economic inequality, and gender justice.",PHIL 233
Understanding Right and Wrong,"We'll examine the three dominant theoretical approaches to answering the fundamental practical question of what makes actions right and wrong. In the process, we'll also investigate questions like: What makes someone a good person? What makes something immoral? What is the relationship between rights and obligations? What makes the world a better place? (Barnes, <em>offered alternate years</em>)",PHIL 234
Philosophy of Law,"Study of the law raises many problems for which philosophy provides solutions. At the same time, the law provides valuable source material bearing on many traditional issues in philosophy. This course studies these problems and issues by examining both philosophical writings on the law and legal opinions. Tort and contract law are examined, as well as criminal and constitutional law. Some of the questions to be considered are: What is law? What is the relation between law and morality? To what extent is the state justified in interfering with a person's liberty? When are persons responsible for their actions? What is justice? When is a person liable for harm caused to others? When is morally justified to punish a person? (Lee, <em>offered alternate years</em>)",PHIL 236
Symbolic Logic,"This course is an introduction to the techniques and theories of formal logic. Topics include translation between English and artificial languages; formal techniques and procedures (natural deduction and truth tables); the concepts of validity, soundness, completeness, and consistency; along the way, we will discuss philosophical questions about logical truth and logical knowledge. (G. Frost-Arnold, <em>offered alternate years</em>)",PHIL 240
Philosophy of Sex and Love,"Sex and love are among some of the most ordinary human (and animal) experiences.  Yet, we often neglect to consider them philosophically.  This neglect stems in part from longstanding dualisms of mind/body and reason/feeling.  This class focuses almost exclusively on bodies and feelings: in doing so it prioritizes what has often been philosophically neglected or rejected. Once we do that, puzzles arise nearly everywhere we look.  Most basically: What is sex itself?  Are sex and sexuality constituent or accidental features of identity?  Are some sex acts morally wrong?  What does it mean to love someone; it is a feeling, an action, or a metaphysical union? Should you commit yourself to someone else, what would it mean to do so?  This class will provide a survey of metaphysical, epistemological, ethical, social, and political concerns about sex and love. We will focus on four main themes: being sexed and sexual, sexual orientations, power and sexualized violence, and marriage, commitment, and non-committal sex.  Topically, we will discuss philosophical dimensions of : sex acts and sexual desires, masturbation, sexualized violence, sexual identities, queer subjectivities, marriage, non-monogamy, pornography, public sex, and sex work.",PHIL 243
Feminism: Ethics and Knowledge,"This course examines various feminist critiques of traditional approaches to ethics and to knowledge. The first half of the course addresses moral issues. Are traditional moral theories adequate for addressing the problems that women face? Do women tend to think about morality differently than men do? What is ""feminist ethics?"" What moral obligations does it assign to individuals? What are its implications for governments and social policy? The second half of the course discusses issues in science and epistemology (i.e., theory of knowledge). Historically, how has science contributed to the subordination of women? Are social and political considerations relevant to science? Is it possible for science to be ""objective?"" What can be done to make science less biased? (K. Frost-Arnold, <em>offered alternate years</em>)",PHIL 250
Health Care Policy,"A governments laws and policies exert a great deal of influence on individuals health and on how they interact with their health care system.  You might be allowed to choose your own doctor or your choices might be restricted.  The system might permit doctors to help terminally ill people to end their own lives, or it may even empower others to make such a choice.  Public policies might encourage or prohibit research to find ways to improve humans by altering their genes.  The government could help everyone get health insurance or they could even take over the whole health care system.  These kinds of public policy decisions would have major economic, political and person ramifications.  The goal of this course is to investigate and understand these choices in health care policy, focusing on the ethical principles that are the foundation of any justification of such policies. (Barnes, <em>offered occasionally</em>)",PHIL 256
Media and Politics,"We live in a world of mediated political realities. Like Plato's prisoners in the cave, we see only shadows, not realities. Yet these shadows have become our reality, through the power of the mass media. This, of course, raises a fundamental question about our ability to be self-governing when our understanding of politics is determined not by the events themselves, but by those who create and report them. (Deutchman, <em>offered annually; subfield: AMER</em>)",POL 212
Politics of China,"This course addresses issues of central concern to Comparative Political Science, such as modernization and its discontents, nation-building and its others, democracy, class, gender, and contention. It does so, however, from closely reading and interpreting how they are discursively framed and contested in China. Students will be required not only to identify the salient topics and debates for each week, but more importantly, to think beyond a concept's familiar usage and track how it changes in different political contexts and narratives. The goal of the course is twofold: to provide a detailed analysis of the core issues of Chinese politics and society and, in doing so, introduce a new vocabulary of the political. (Staff, <em>offered occasionally; COMP</em>)",POL 213
Racial and Ethnic Politics,"This course examines the historical and contemporary relationship between ethnic minority and majority groups in the American political system. The course looks at the use and effectiveness of political and social power in shaping American race relations and the ability of alternative methods to change those relations. The focus of the course is largely on the relationship between U.S. society and African Americans, but Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Native Americans are also covered. (Rose, <em>offered annually; subfield: AMER</em>)",POL 215
Political Parties,"Despite early skepticism and modern contempt, political parties have become integral components of the American political process. This course examines the historical and contemporary functions of American political parties in the context of the wishes of the American public, the desires of political officials, and the needs of the nation. It outlines the operational, functional, and electoral factors that shape the American party system. The course further examines the role and challenges of third parties in the U.S. (Lucas, <em>offered annually, subfield AMER</em>)",POL 222
Sex and Power,"The overwhelmingly male bias in the American political system raises fundamental questions about equity, justice, and the representation of all interests. The feminist movement, in an attempt to answer some of these questions, has in effect redefined politics itself, fundamentally altering the terms of the debate. This course uses the framework that ""the personal is political"" to critique the American political system from a variety of feminist perspectives. Specifically, the course focuses on the issues of the sexual revolution, rape and pornography, and the sexuality debates within the feminist community. (Deutchman, <em>offered annually; subfield: AMER</em>)",POL 238
The Mystery of East Central Europe,"East Central Europe has always been a place to explore big questions. The region has been at the center of the worlds major political developments  nationalism, imperialism, fascism, communism, democratization, global capitalism  and also its culture: there is no western culture without the contributions from the regions writers, artists, and intellectuals. How can a small region contribute so much to the world? This course not only explores the mesmerizing past and present of a fascinating part of the world, but uses that to understand us, too  because so many aspects that emerge there become prevalent in more western societies soon afterwards. The focus of the course will be on Poland and Hungary (with forays into Ukraine, the Baltic republics, Czechia and Slovakia), and the concepts of nation, class, and gender. We look at processes of state and nation building; the impact of religion and minorities (including Jews and anti-Semitism); the impact of class conflicts; and the role of gender-based social movements as well as traditionalist backlashes against them. We inquire into the nature of post-communist democracy, and we look also at a variety of public policies, concerning child and family policy, and Internet policy. We also explore the transformative impact East Central Europe has had on the European Union. (Ost, <em>alternate years; subfield: COMP</em>)",POL 243
Politics of the New Europe,"This course studies the evolution of postwar Europe - from radicalism to globalism, the welfare state to Blairist Thatcherism, Stalinism to the fall of the Berlin wall, American domination to the rise of the European Union. The focus of the course is the rise and fall of class politics. It explores what capitalism and socialism have meant to Europe, and contrasts European with U.S. politics. Topics include the crisis of prewar Europe, Keynesianism and communism, the meaning of 1968, radicalism, populism, the new right, and the New Europe. (Ost, <em>offered alternate years; subfield: COMP</em>)",POL 245
Politics of East Asia,"How have East Asian countries become one of the largest economies in the world, developing industries, such as Toyota and Samsung? How did two Koreas become enemy states in spite of more than five thousand years of shared history and culture? Will Japan be remilitarized? What are the relationships among China, Taiwan, Tibet, and Hong Kong? In what way has the U.S. played a role in the development of the region? The course will explore diverse questions by looking at the process of state-building, political economy, security, and cultural dynamics of East Asia, focusing on China, Japan, and North and South Koreas, in connection to the role of the U.S. (Staff, <em>offered occasionally; IR, COMP</em>)",POL 246
Politics of Development,"This course examines contending historical and contemporary explanations for the phenomenon of entrenched global poverty and critically assesses proposed policy solutions to ending absolute poverty in our time. The courses contrast micro-level approaches, which seek to build an ""inclusive capitalism"" through the extension of property rights and the enhancement of individual capacity with macro-level approaches that seek to restructure the international regime on debt relief and international development organizations.

"Protests, Movements, Unions","This is a course in ""unconventional"" politics around the globe. In recent years, movements have become an inexorable part of the current political system. What are movements? How and why do they come about? What are their aims and purposes? How have movements changed over the past century? Why and when do movements become revolutions? Topics include the Russian Revolution, the lure of communism, the civil rights movement in the U.S., the struggle against communism in Eastern Europe, transnational social movements, and the ""alternative globalization"" movement. The course also includes theoretical social science readings on the causes, nature, and consequences of protests and movements.

Media Industries and Alternatives,"At the end of a contemporary feature film, a credit sequence may list hundreds of individuals and companies. How can we understand the roles that these credited collaborators (and other uncredited collaborators) play in media production? How do issues of media ownership and media authorship influence media cultures? This course combines an analysis of contemporary media industries (including film, television, and new media) with an analysis of alternative sites of media production (including indigenous, independent, and amateur media). The course's investigation of cultures of production, promotion, and distribution will introduce students to the emerging field of media industries studies and its exploration of global media cultures and media convergence. We will examine the roles of various institutions (studios, networks, publishers, unions, not-for-profit agencies, etc.) and individuals (directors, writers, costume designers, gaffers, publicists, stylists, agents, critics, etc.) in the production and reception of contemporary media. We will draw on a broad range of production case studies which may include: Hollywood blockbusters, Nigerian video films, independent web television series, and the Italian dubbing industry.

Global Cinema,"This course investigates contemporary global cinema, charting the boundaries of the term global cinema as a critical and industrial framework.What is global cinema? Why do some films circulate internationally while others remain fixed within national or regional cultures?How have new media modes of distribution like instant streaming shaped global cinema?Through a focus on the politics and economics of film distribution, we will explore global cinema and its intersections with various national cinemas, including the cinemas of the U.S., Italy, India, China, Mexico, Japan, Senegal, Iran, Peru, and Canada, among others.We will consider the impact of international film festivals, trade policies, immigration, transnational stardom, piracy, translation, and censorship on contemporary global cinema.",MDSC 313
Script to Screen II: The Workshop,"This course provides intensive practice in the use of visual tools and techniques to express meaning and tell stories. It is about cinematic storytelling, which has been defined by Van Sijll ""as the difference between documenting and dramatizing."" We will explore the manipulation and interaction of composition, lenses, movement, lighting and other aspects of the mise-en-scene through analysis and practice. (Jimenez, <em>offered occasionally</em>)",MDSC 314
Introduction to Social Documentary,"This course is an introduction to the power of the visual social documentary as a force for social change. Students will study the history of social documentary photography and film and learn how to research, develop, shoot, edit, and critique social documentary videos using introductory level cameras and editing software. Considerable time must be spent working independently and collaboratively outside of regular class time. (Robertson, <em>offered alternate years</em>)",MDSC 315
Media Economics,"This course uses economic analysis to study the media industry, including TV, video, print, music and new media. The course begins by reviewing/introducing basic economic concepts. Then develop the framework for industry studies in the field of industrial organization. Students will then prepare industry studies.

Global Musicals,"What do song and dance bring to film narratives? Why, in spite of the musical genre's fantastic unreality have audiences around the world embraced it for so long? How does the seductive combination of movement, rhythm, image, and narrative operate in relation to social politics and history? In this course we will take a transnational approach to analyzing this foundational and yet quirky form. Together, we will learn about the industrial, cultural, and social factors that shaped the musical's place in popular culture's around the world: Hollywood in the United States, DEFA musicals in East Germany. Bollywood, New Taiwanese cinema, and Canadian queer cinema. In each of these case studies, we will discuss the genre's relationship to form and meaning, and what  function this type of expression serves within to socio-historical context of its production. Finally, we will explore how the musical has moved across different media platforms by examining its presence in television, flash mobs and viral videos, and commercials.",MDSC 329
Special Topics: Studies in Media and Production,"This course will address a range of topics in accordance with the current scholarly interests of the Media and Society faculty and visiting artists. Therefore, the topics do vary as they address timely issues of research in Media Studies and Production as well as emerging areas in the field. Typical topics could include: portrait documentary, animation beyond Disney, cinematic video games, the end of celluloid, and transmedia narratives. Students may not take the same topic twice for credit.",MDSC 330
Senior Seminar,"This course is required of all Media and Society majors. Normally, seniors will enroll in this course; however, juniors may also enroll with the recommendation of their advisers. This seminar, which is a capstone course for the major, will focus on a topic determined by the instructor. This is a research-intensive course. (<em>Offered annually</em>)",MDSC 400
Advanced Social Documentary,"This course is for students with a serious interest in documentary videography. The course will concentrate on developing a television-quality documentary. The focus of the course will be on developing a concept, scriptwriting, filming, and editing for the purpose of informing, persuading, or convincing an audience. The topics will include a contemporary issue, or a history that sheds light on a contemporary issue. Students enrolling in this course should expect to spend considerable time outside of the ordinary class period in research, production and post-production. The ability to work well as a member of a collaborative team is essential. Prerequisite: MDSC 315 or instructor's consent. (Robertson)",MDSC 415
Mind and Language,"One fascinating feature of language and mind is that both are able to carry information: sentences and beliefs have content or meaning. In other words, sentences and beliefs are about something. This course investigates several questions involving linguistic and mental content. How do words and mental states acquire their content? What is the meaning of a word or sentence? For example, is the meaning of a proper name (e.g. 'Thomas Jefferson') simply the entity bearing that name, or must its meaning be more complex? What is the relationship between mental content and linguistic expressions: that is, do features of the language we speak determine which thoughts we can have, or vice versa? (G. Frost-Arnold, <em>offered occasionally</em>)",PHIL 260
Medieval Philosophy,"This course is a survey on common themes in Medieval philosophy. It explores on issues elaborated in the works of major Christian, Muslim, and Jewish philosophers. Among these issues include Being and its modalities, Perfect Being and the world, free and pre-determination, universals and particulars, and causality. It especially discusses the interplay between Platonic, Aristotelian and Neoplatonic views on the one hand and religious teachings on the other, as expressed in the works of medieval philosophers such as Augustine, Sa'adia, Ibn Sina, Maimonides, Averroes, Aquinas, and Ibn Tufayl.",PHIL 271
GOD,"This course examines both the nature of God and the foundation of rational belief in God. The traditional understanding of God, at least according to the Abrahamic religions, is a being that is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent. However, each of these properties introduces classical philosophical problems. The puzzle of omnipotence challenges the idea that omnipotence is even a coherent notion. The dilemma of freedom and foreknowledge implies that God's omniscience is incompatible with human freedom. Last, the problem of evil gives reason to doubt that God is truly omnibenevolent. In sum, the class explores the following majors questions: does God exist? What is God like? How do we know what God is like? Do we have good evidence for belief in God? If not, can we still have rational belief in God?",PHIL 275
Seminar: Social Justice,"Justice is demanded by people and for people all around us. Many claim that they or others are being treated unjustly, but to recognize which of these demands we should acknowledge, we need to understand what justice is. Our focus in this seminar will be on social justice, the justice of how individuals are treated by society, rather then how we treat each other as private persons. One of the main topics considered is distributive justice. The first part of this seminar will be dominated by a discussion of the work of John Rawls, the most significant English-language political philosopher of the 20th century. Then we consider other theoretical approaches to social justice, such as strict egalitarianism, libertarianism, resource and welfare based approaches, and feminist and capabilities approaches. We will also consider social just on a global scale. (Lee, <em>offered annually</em>)",PHIL 315
Experiencing and Knowing,"Why should we believe What others tell us? How do we know the external world Exists? How reliable are the inductive methods of science? How can we tell when we have achieved knowledge? What is the scope of human knowledge? What are its limits? This course examines some 20th century discussions of these and similar questions that have long intrigued thinkers wishing to understand the capacities of the human mind. (K. Frost-Arnold, <em>offered alternate years</em>)",PHIL 342
"Power, Privilege, and Knowledge","How is power used to shape the knowledge produced in a society? How does my race or gender influence my knowledge and ignorance? These are key questions in social epistemology, which is the study of the social dynamics of knowledge. In this course, students explore the historical beginnings of social epistemology in the work of Marx, Foucault and Goldman. Drawing on this history, students conduct a sophisticated study of contemporary work by feminists and philosophers of race. Among the topics discussed are: the corporatization of science, knowledge of the female orgasm, white ignorance, and strategies for becoming a responsible knower in a world of power and privilege. (K. Frost-Arnold, <em>offered alternate years</em>)",PHIL 345
Critical Theory: Philosophy of History and Culture,"This course is an upper-level examination of a broad set of philosophical movements that fall under the classification of critical theory.  Karl Marx describes critical theory as  ""the self-clarification of the struggles and wishes of the age.""  We will begin by looking at critical theory's genesis in left-Hegelianism, through Weberian social theory and Freudian psychoanalysis.  We will then consider the first generation of theorists from the Frankfurt School (Benjamin, Adorno, and Horkheimer), paying particular attention  to their critiques of Enlightenment theories and instrumental reason.  We will then look at the way in which critical theory splits into two particular traditions:  critical theories of democratic practice in capitalist societies, via Habermas and Fraser, and critical theories of embodied life in administered society, via Foucault and Butler.  We will focus on four main aspects of critical theory in this course: the dialectic, the relation of subject-object, the philosophy of history (specifically, the idea of progress), and the question of ideology.",PHIL 346
Theories of Reality,"This course will focus on questions such as the following: What is real? Is the material world the only reality? Are properties, like being round, or being rational, as real as things? Is mind, awareness, consciousness, a different sort of reality? Are people simply complex machines? Are human beings free to create their own futures? With respect to physical reality, we will consider issues such as causality, space, time, and substance. For persons, we will examine the relationship between mind and body, the idea of personal identity, and the nature of human free will and responsibility. Both classical and contemporary perspectives will be considered. (Oberbrunner, <em>offered annually</em>)",PHIL 350
Philosophy of Time,"We seemingly experience the phenomenon of time every day. But what exactly is it? One of the greatest philosophers of time, C. D. Broad, declared that the problem of understanding time is ""the hardest knot in the whole of philosophy."" This course is an attempt to begin to unravel this knot. The topics are divided into two main sections reflecting the two main issues in the philosophy of time: the ontology of time and the properties of time. The ontology of time concerns, first and foremost, whether time is real, and, if so, whether only the present exists or whether the past and the future exist along with the present. The second section of the course concerns the consideration of the particular properties of time that give rise to several well-known questions involving time: How does time pass? What gives time its direction? Can we time travel into the past or future? These questions seem simple, but as one attempts to seek answers, it becomes clear that no obvious answers are to be found. Thus, this class ultimately serves not only as a philosophical introduction to the basic issues concerning time but also offers to students an illustration of how to structure and think through abstract issues.",PHIL 355
Ancient Philosophy,"This course is a survey of the Origins of Western philosophy. The course focuses on ancient Greek views of the nature of reality, morality, and knowledge. The great philosophers of the Classical period are studied in detail. The emphasis throughout this course is on understanding, analyzing, and evaluating the arguments and theories of these philosophers. Typical readings include: Plato, Euthyphro, Meno, Symposium, and Republic; Aristotle, Categories, Nichomachean Ethics, and Politics. (King, <em>offered annually</em>)",PHIL 370
Globalization,"This course looks at five themes: global economics, global migration, global civil society, global human rights, and global institutions. Students examine how international mobility of both capital and labor transforms both lives and politics, and in different ways in different places. Questions include: Why do jobs and people go abroad? Who does it help and who does it hurt? What are the politics of the Caribbean nanny in the middle-class New York home? How does globalization weaken the state, and why is that so dangerous for democracy? Can transnational civil activism make things better? Can the UN or World Bank do a better job? Do ""global human rights"" exist? Should they? (Ost, Yadav, <em>offered alternate years; subfields: COMP, IR</em>)",POL 254
Latin American Politics,"This course examines how politics in Latin American countries have been shaped by their differing historical role in supplying raw materials for First World consumption, tracing how the production of various crops (coffee, bananas, wheat) or goods (tin, beef) have led countries to develop different social structures and corresponding political systems. It also considers how recent efforts by social groups (women, indigenous people) to gain a greater voice in government have been both inspired and impeded by neoliberal reforms. (Norman, <em>offered occasionally; subfield: COMP</em>)",POL 255
Comparative Politics of the Middle East,"This course explores the complex and shifting relationships between state and society in the late colonial and post-colonial Middle East. Paying particular attention to questions of state-building and development, it explores the ways in which state legitimacy is variously supported and challenged by alternative sites of authority in society. Course topics will address a variety of secular and religious movements, the role of state and anti-state violence, and the impact of economic and cultural globalization, among others.

African Politics,"The course traces the evolution of the African state from its colonial creation to its modern day ""crisis"" through an examination of how political, economic and social considerations have shaped and transformed African politics. The first section of the course examines the historical creation of contemporary African polities from the era of European colonization. In the second section, attention is paid to the creative solutions that African societies have employed as a response to both unique and universal problems of governance. (Dunn, <em>offered alternate years; subfield: COMP</em>)",POL 259
Modern Political Theory,"Reading texts from Locke through Nietzsche, this course considers the relation between freedom and slavery in modern European and American political theory. It interrogates the notion of the autonomous subject and the idea of instrumental reason that animates it. Additionally, it reads the self-criticism that is always part of the Enlightenment tradition for alternative conceptions of equality, interconnection, and human flourishing. (Dean, <em>offered annually; subfield TH</em>)",POL 265
20th Century Political Theory,"This course focuses on key problems in 20th century political theory. The 20th century was marked by extreme violence - two world wars, the use of atomic weapons, genocide on a mass scale-as well as grand experiments in participatory government, extensions of basic rights, and developments in technology and science. As the century ended, some theorists claimed that ideology had ended as well; they argued that one version of human flourishing, one based in economic markets, had clearly triumphed. Other theorists were deeply critical of the claim for the end of ideology as well as of the association of markets and flourishing, not to mention of the suppositions that technologies were unambiguously beneficial and that rights were the best ways to secure freedom. Readings will vary by term but will be chosen from key texts from European and American political theorists and their critics, for example, Freud, Lenin, Gramsci, Simone de Beauvoir, Habermas, Hardt and Negri. (Dean, Passavant, <em>offered annually; subfield: TH</em>)",POL 267
Radical Thought from Karl Marx to George Bush,"This course examines left and right radical thought of the past 150 years. Students read the left radicals Marx and Lenin and anti-Soviet leftists such as the Frankfurt School and Sartre, as well as the anomalous approach of the anarchists and Freud, who influenced both left and right thinkers. Students then examine right-wing radicalism, reading the work of influential fascists, followed by postwar American radical thought. On the left, that means Herbert Marcuse's New Left classic One Dimensional Man, Fanon and ""Third Worldism,"" and the re-embrace of liberalism with the discovery of ""civil society."" On the right, that means the rise of the neoconservatives, from Allen Bloom to William Kristol, both important influences on George Bush and his entourage. Finally, students look at left responses to neo-conservatism, from Russell Jacoby to Zizek. (Ost, <em>offered occasionally; subfield: TH</em>)",POL 279
Political Violence,"Conflict has been a central issue in the relations among states since the advent of the modern nation-state system. Well before Sept. 11, 2001, terrorism had become a central feature of how conflict has been expressed in the modern international system. This course examines the causes of terrorism, the ways in which individuals and social groups have chosen to wage terrorism, the goals they have established, and the ways in which political and military leaders have chose to engage in counter-terrorist strategies. Using specific case studies, the course compares the motivations and implications of ethno-nationalist terrorism, political terrorism, and religious terrorism, and the future of terrorism in a post-Sept. 11 world.

International Politics of the Middle East,"This course examines international politics in the Middle East in the late colonial and post-colonial periods, focusing on the relationships between states, societies, and markets. Placing particular emphasis on the many ways in which the high politics of states shape the lived experiences of different communities in the region, it works within existing theoretical frameworks in International Relations that envision politics as influenced by shifting constellations of interests, ideas, and institutions.

American Foreign Policy,"This course is an introduction to the study of American foreign policy. The first section provides an historical overview of American foreign policy since World War II, highlighting the important events, themes, and trends that have shaped - and continue to shape - the making and practice of American foreign policy. The second section explores the process of foreign policy making within the American political context. This section examines the ""nuts-and-bolts"" of how decisions are made and implemented. The third and final section presents key foreign policy issues facing the United States today. (Dunn; <em>offered annually; subfield: IR</em>)",POL 290
Early Modern Philosophy,"This course is an introduction to the principal works and central theories of the early modern period (1600-1750). The philosophical thought of this period was closely tied to the newly developing sciences and also to profound changes in religion, politics, and morality. Accompanying the transformation of thinking in all of these areas was a renewed interest in skeptical theories from ancient sources, and what emerged was the beginning of uniquely modern approaches to philosophy. Each year this course focuses on a handful of texts from this period, to be selected from the works of Montaigne, Bacon, Galileo, Descartes, Hobbes, Arnauld, Gassendi, Mersenne, Leibniz, Spinoza, Boyle, Butler, Malebranche, Pascal, Newton, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume. (Brophy, <em>offered annually</em>)",PHIL 372
Kant,"Kant's critical and transcendental investigations of the limits of the ability of the human mind to resolve issues of what we can know and how we should act have been enormously influential for all subsequent philosophical inquiry. This course is devoted to understanding the problems Kant faced, the answers he advanced, and the difficult and intriguing arguments he provided to support his views. Because understanding Kant's empirical realism and transcendental idealism is incomplete without critical scrutiny of his argument, objections are introduced and discussed. (Baer, <em>offered annually</em>)",PHIL 373
Contemporary Philosophy,"This course traces the development of contemporary philosophy in the analytic tradition from G.E. Moore, Frege, and Bertrand Russell through Wittgenstein, Quine, and beyond.

"Racism, Class, and Conflicts","Why is racism so prevalent? What makes nationalism, anti-Semitism, or anti-Islamism such compelling ""narratives"" that so many people and countries adopt them? What purposes do racisms and hatreds serve? And why do class conflicts serve the cause of democracy better than identity conflicts do? This course explores the role that organized conflicts and hatreds play around the world, the ways they are used to gain power, consolidate nations, legitimate domination, secure dignity (at others' expense), or deflect attention. Polities cannot do without conflicts, but how these conflicts are organized has profound implications for how inclusive, or not, the political system will be. We explore histories of racist thought, and politicized animosities such as racisms in the US, anti-Semitism in Europe, ethnic conflicts in Africa, apartheid, anti-Chinese campaigns, anti-Islamism, as well as conflicts based on class. We will see hatreds less as psychological phenomena than political ones, which can be combatted on that level as well. Prerequisite: a 100- or 200-level POL course or by permission of instructor.

Histories of Sexuality In the West,"This course introduces students to a range of theories on sexuality and sexual identities, with a focus on the historical emergence of critical sexuality studies and queer theory in the late 20th century. Beginning with foundational ideas about human sexuality as they were established in sexology and psychoanalysis, the course then moves into feminist and queer analyses of the relationships between sexuality, identity, society, and the operation of power. Along with keystone texts by Sigmund Freud, Michel Foucault, and Judith Butler, we will engage with feminist, postcolonial, and queer revisions of the history of sexuality in the West as a history of domination, subjection, empire building, and colonization.",LGBT 202
Queer Geographies and Migrations,"How do the spaces we live in - our houses, neighborhoods, cities, environments, and national territories - impact the way we think about our sexual identities, orientations, and subcultures? This course will examine the relationships between gender, sexuality and space through the fundamental concepts of cultural geography, urban planning, and architecture. We will be thinking about space on multiple scales, starting with examining the body as ""the geography closest in"" (Rich) and ""the closet"" as a metaphor for those who identify as sexual and gender minorities but do not disclose their identities. We will then move to a consideration of dwelling spaces: How do our living spaces reflect cultural assumptions about sexuality, family structures, and kinship? How do urban and rural spaces and their imaginaries reflect and shape cultural assumptions about ""normal"" bodies? How do nations, nationalism, settler-colonial spaces, and transnationalisms shape ideas about sexuality at the level of population? How do migration and mobility practices across multiple borders affect sexual and gendered subjectivities? What spaces of resistance are queer people cultivating? As we ask these questions, we will necessarily be asking larger ones: how is knowledge and power wrapped up in how we organize and make meaning form different spaces?",LGBT 301
Trans*Studies,"Through a focus on the tensions between feminist, queer, and trans theory and activism, this course explores the burgeoning academic field of Trans Studies. The course opens with the infamous debates between some lesbian and radical feminists and trans scholars, activists, and artists around femininity and ""authentic"" womanhood beginning in the late 1970s. From there, we move into the ""border wars"" between queer and trans scholars that unfolded around the question of masculinity in the late 1990s. We then turn our focus to contemporary activism and scholarship that might be described as distinctively ""trans*feminist."" This part of the course explores trans*feminist approaches to anti-Black racism, decolonizing/indigenous/two-spirit activism, prisons, shelters, and sex work. In conclusion, we reflect upon the recent institutionalization of Trans Studies to (re)consider the resonances in political investment that run across the interrelated fields of feminist, queer, and trans studies.",LGBT 302
Queer Theory: LGBTQ Senior Capstone Seminar,"This senior seminar is a culminating experience for the major, requiring majors to engage in a sustained research/praxis project which brings together queer methods and theories and applies them to a socially engaged context.

Trekking through Asia,"(from the Asian Studies dept.; goals from the History dept.) Welcome to the ""Asian Century."" Asia has re-emerged as the center of the world, after a brief hiatus that started in the 18th century. With histories and religious traditions stretching back three millennia, today as we see cultures across Asia have transformed in ways to meet the demands of our rapidly changing world. China, Japan, and India are three of the world's top economies. Asia contains six of the world's ten largest countries, and is home to over half of the world's population and two of the world's major religions, Hinduism and Buddhism. For decades Asian countries have been leaders in global manufacturing, and Asian universities are now renowned centers for scientific and medical innovation. Fifty percent of the declared nuclear-weapon states are also in the region. Simply put, Asia matters a great deal! In this course, we trek through the Asian past and present, exploring this vast and vibrant region. Through writings and travelogues that documented the peoples and lands of places stretching from the Sea of Japan to Persia, and from Java to the Mediterranean Sea, we will learn about the cultural systems that helped shape Asian societies.

Modern Mexican History,"This course examines the construction of Mexican national culture through the formation of the modern Mexican state, from 1810 to the present. Mexico emerged as a nation-state as part of a larger, transnational process of democratic-nationalist revolutions, steeped in the languages and ideologies of nationalism, liberalism, and democracy. In applying these new models of society, however, elite state-builders continued to bar large sectors of the population from access to social citizenship based on ethnic, class, and gender exclusionary criteria. This contradiction has continued to haunt Mexico throughout history. This course is a historical examination of how social citizenship and Mexicanness have been understood and disputed across racial, class, gender, and regional lines, beginning with the nation's foundational contradiction. (Ristow, <em>offered annually</em>)",HIST 205

History of Medieval Women,"This class challenges this assumption by introducing the major historical questions, people, trends, and texts relating to women in the Middle Ages. Beginning with the end of the Roman world and ending in 1500 CE, this course will focus on four topics relating to women: marriage, work, the body, and religiosity. For each section, the class will explore how these categories change over time in the medieval period within Europe. Also in each section, an entire class period will be devoted to the life of a medieval woman whose life and writings reflected the questions of that period.",HIST 209
American Urban History,"This course examines the urbanization of American society from the colonial period to the present, with emphasis on the development of the physical city. It explores the establishment and growth of colonial cities; the impact of technological innovations such as mass transit and the automobile on urban spatial form; the changing responses to urban problems such as water, fire, pollution, housing, crime and disorder; the advent of city planning; the relationship between ethnic and racial conflicts and urban form, especially suburbanization; and the rise of the contemporary decentralized city.

Early Medieval Europe,"This is an essential course on the Middle Ages that will be taught in Maureen Flynn's absence by Sarah Whitten. Early medieval Europe and the Mediterranean shared an inheritance from the Roman world of Roman institutions, Christianity, and barbarian identities. The civilizations that developed in the West including the Merovingians, Lombards, Carolingians, Byzantines, and early Islamic dynasties were profoundly shaped by all these components in varied ways. Beginning with the later Roman Empire, the course is organized around political shifts but also covers developments in religious, legal, economic, social, and cultural history. Major themes of the class include the changing nature of religious authority, political fragmentation, and legal transformation.",HIST 220

History of American Thought to 1865,"This course traces the development of major ideas in a broad array of fields, including politics, religion, psychology, and history, through the Civil War era. While it focuses chiefly on formal thought, it also pays attention to trends in popular culture and to the social context. It relies heavily on primary source readings, a number of which are literary in character. Some questions examined involve the relationship between intellectual and social change, the distinctiveness of American thought, and the role of an intellectual elite in a democratic society. (Crow)",HIST 233
History of American Thought from 1865,"This course covers the history of American thought and culture from the late Victorian period to the present, examining forces that led Americans to rebel against the Victorian world view and which were responsible for the rise of Modernism. Social and political thought are emphasized, but the rise of the social sciences, new philosophical movements, theology and aesthetics, American identity, the emergence of the university as a major cultural institution, and the role of the intellectual in modern America are also discussed. There is no prerequisite, but HIST 336 is recommended. (Crow)",HIST 234
Civil War and Reconstruction,"In America's mid-nineteenth century, rising tensions over slavery's expansion, diverging ideas about federalism, and polarizing sectional identities erupted into violence, leading to four years of protracted, brutal war. The outcome was nothing less than revolutionary: the nation's political structures, economic systems, and social hierarchies were transformed. Paying careful attention to Americans' lived experiences, in this course we will seek to understand how and why the Civil War began, what changes it wrought, whether or not its fundamental conflicts were solved by Reconstruction, and finally, why it continues to have such a profound impact on America's vision of itself even today.

Introduction to German Area Studies I,"This course represents students' first exposure to the field of German Area Studies. In addition to improving the students' ability to express their thoughts clearly, concisely, and correctly in spoken and written German, the class will introduce students to core issues of the field, i.e. the culture of German-speaking Europe in various forms and expressions. Besides learning about canonical texts and figures, students will also explore film, music, politics, and pop-culture as contributors to the culture of central Europe. In addition, the skills that constitute intercultural competence are also developed and honed via projects, for example the role of geography in the construction of German culture.

German Cinema,"This course will introduce students to all the major periods of German cinema and the historical contexts that gave rise to them: from silent ""Orientals"" and expressionist film in the Weimar Era to the propaganda film of Hitler's Third Reich, from postwar cinema that sought to reconstruct and rewrite national identity to transnational and queer cinema that sought to unhinge essentialism from German identity, and from the work of the great auteurs of New German Cinema and Turkish-German Cinema. By drawing out the complex relationship between politics and film, we will learn to appreciate and interrogate the role that film has played in shaping and being shaped by German history, society, and culture.",GERE 104
Guilt in German Literature,"Whether incest, murder, or betrayal, crime and the resulting guilt are recurring themes in the literature of German-speaking Europe. One genre in particular contains a high number of stories chronicling transgression and sin  the novella. The novella enjoys a prominent place in the literature of Central Europe and especially during the 19th century. We will conduct close readings of numerous creepy, eerie, and ghoulish novellas written by German-speaking authors over the past two hundred years. The course will have three main goals: to introduce students to major movements and significant voices of German-speaking Europe; to introduce students to the genre of the novella; and to investigate how guilt and punishment are represented in these texts. ",GERE 208
The Cave of Western Thought,"This course is designed to question the ways in which (y)our world comes into being using the image of the cave to mine the mysterious depths of mind, soul, and being. Are we shackled in the belly of a mountain, as Plato contends in his Allegory of the Cave, until we realize Truth, or is Truth to be found in the dark and deep depths within Plato's cave? What are the multifarious uses of the cave in literature that reference human experience, sensory and spiritual, and how and why does the cave come to represent such divergent themes of enlightenment, freedom, power, sense perception, love, and language? Taking cues primarily from the German-language literary tradition, we will also learn how philosophy has infused various literary periods and genres, from Medieval Epic to Modern Film.",GERE 212
"Border, Nation, Identity","With a focus on literature addressing two epochal events of the 20th century-the 1947 Partition of India/Pakistan and the 1990 Reunification of East/West Germany-this course takes a comparative approach to understand the nature of the national border. We will ask a myriad questions that interrogate the efficacy of national borders as markers of human identity. What is a national border and how is it drawn, how is it erased? What role do politics, religion, and language play in establishing a community within a border? What mythologies bring people together as a nation? In which ways is a national border divisive? We will study these two moments in history primarily from the vantage pint of fictional literature, including novels, short stories, poetry and film. We will supplement our exploration of fictional texts with the study of treatises, essays, correspondence, speeches, and documentary photography and film. By reading fiction alongside non-fiction, we will be able to examine how a national border is simultaneously a thing of the imagination and of grave physicality.",GERE 213
World Wars in Global Perspective,"The American century; the formation of Communist states; genocides, including the Armenian massacres and the destruction of European Jewry; the ongoing crisis in the Middle East; and the relative decline of Europe and decolonization were all closely linked to the two world wars. This course explores these two cataclysmic wars: their origins, conduct, and consequences. In addition to such traditional approaches as military, political, and diplomatic history, students use literary, artistic, and cinematic representations to view these wars through personal experiences.

Immigration and Ethnicity in America,"What is an American? This course examines this question by analyzing the sources of mass immigration to the United States, the encounters among various immigrant groups and natives, and the changing conceptions of ethnicity. The course covers the period from the 1840s to the present. It starts with the Irish and Germans who emigrated in the early 19th century, then consider the Russian Jews, Italians, and others who began arriving in the 1890s, and then investigates the post-1965 emigration from Asia, the Americas, and India that is remaking the country today. Reference is also made to the internal migrations of African-Americans. (Hood, <em>offered alternate years</em>)",HIST 240
Riding with Genghis Khan,"Genghis Khan and his descendants rode hard, fought bloody battles, envisioned world conquest, and drank copiously. They also created the largest land empire in the world, ruled over this empire effectively, and fostered cultural exchange across Eurasia at an unprecedented scale. After its fall, the empire's legacies continued to impact Eurasian history, arguable to this day. This course explores aspects of this great empire, from its Central Asian nomadic origins to the Mongol predicament after its fall. Our main focus is Genghis and the Mongol empire. Learn about the awesome Mongol battle strategies, and their administration that led to Pax Mongolica. Witness the magnificent courts and peoples that Marco Polo, or his reverse counterpart, Rabban Sauma, encountered, as you experience the excitement of their adventures. Explore how Mongols lived every day, and how they saw the world around them. Investigate how they adapted to various natural surroundings, and how they interacted with their various human neighbors, most famously the Chinese and the Persians. Consider why the great Khan remains widely known today, and why so many myths surround him. Let's ride through history with Genghis.",HIST 242
U.S. Constitution to 1865,"This course examines the development of constitutionalism in what would become the United States from its origins in medieval and early modern English law and institutions to the ratification of the U.S. Constitution, the codification of slavery, the Marshall Court, expansion policy, the American Civil War, and the beginning of Reconstruction. Major themes include the legacy of colonial and imperial governance for subsequent American history, the changing politics of constitutional interpretation, the politics of slavery, law, labor, and economic change, and the shifting grounds of legitimacy for the exercise of power on the national level.

American Environmental History,"In this course, historical place in the natural landscape is described through the methods of environmental history, embracing three concerns: ecological relationships between humans and nature, political and economic influences on the environment, and cultural conceptions of the natural world. Drawing on methods from the natural and social sciences, and the humanities, students will survey 500 years of American environmental history, from the ecological conflicts of Indians and settlers to recent debates over endangered species and hazardous wastes. Topics range from urban pollution and suburban sprawl to agricultural practices and wilderness protection. (Hood, <em>offered alternate years</em>)",HIST 246
Medieval Popular Culture,"What is the relationship between high and low culture? How do oral cultures think, and how have literacy and electronic media transformed human consciousness in more recent times? Close exploration of the material conditions of peasant life, of the psychological workings of folklore, magic, witchcraft, and play in culture help students come to terms with these issues. We assess the historical consequences of oppression within the political structure of the three estates and evaluate the efficacy of various techniques of popular resistance. In the end, we assess the value of play in sustaining social cohesion, emotional stability and personal freedom in our historical heritage. (Flynn, <em>offered annually</em>)",HIST 250
Technology and Society,"The coming of modern machinery has fundamentally altered the nature of work, and has thoroughly transformed communications, warfare, international relations, leisure time, and the arts. This course examines the impact of machinery on social relations and human relations to nature. It explores the promotion and institutionalization of technical innovation in the last two centuries in Europe. Finally, it views the conflicting intellectual and social responses to technological change, ranging from fantasies of technocratic utopias to machine smashing and dark visions of humanity displaced and dominated by mechanized systems.

The Russian Land,"If required to select one country through which to understand the human experience, or today's most pressing problems, Russia would be an excellent choice. Appearing first at the interface between agrarian and tribal worlds, Russia has a thousand years of experience dealing with Islam, for example, and offers clear instruction about what does and does not work. And countries all over the world are struggling along economic and political paths and models first articulated and explored by Russians centuries ago. Long before Latin American or African or Asian countries began their responses to western power, Russia was grappling with the challenge of modernity, trying to compete economically, trying to adjust without losing her identity. Finally, whatever contemporary issue draws our attentionthe environment, women's condition, civil liberties, terrorism, ethnic violence, the arts, drugs, developmentRussia has much to teach us about nearly every one. The course will typically require such readings as: Turchin, <em>War and Peace and War: the Life Cycles of Imperial Nations</em>; Figes, <em>Natasha's Dance</em>; Lahuse, <em>How Life Writes the Book</em>; Libert, <em>The Environmental Heritage of Soviet Agriculture</em>.",HIST 263
Modern European City,"This course examines the emergence and development of new industrial cities, such as Manchester and Bochum, and the transformation of older administrative and cultural centers such as Paris and Vienna. The course emphasizes the ways in which contrasting visions of the city as ""source of crime and pathology"" or ""fount of economic dynamism and democratic sociability"" were expressed and embodied in city planning, reform movements, and the arts. In exploring the modern city, students use perspectives derived from European and American social and political thought and employ literary, statistical, and visual source materials.

Nazi Germany,"Nazi Germany and the Hitler Regime remain epitomes of political evil. This course explores the formation, ideology, and dynamic of the Third Reich, concentrating on politics, economics, social policy, and cultural policies of the regime. Students examine the combination of terror and everyday life, utopian promise, and the extermination of Jews and other minorities that lay at the heart of Hitler's regime. They also consider the ways in which the regime has been interpreted by historians and political scientists and the way the Nazi regime has been represented since its defeat in 1945.

Some of the topics covered are: the rise and transformation of the European State system; the Reformation; the development of capitalism and a class society; the origins of democratic liberalism; scientific and technological revolution; the Enlightenment; imperialism and colonization; the development of the modern subject; and Europe in the age of globalization.,EUST 102
Cant Buy Me Love: The Commodification of everyday Life,"What does it mean when you pay someone to look after your elderly parents, clean your house, walk your dog or even to spend time with you? In today's service-based economy, it is strikingly difficult to think of a service or activity that one cannot buy, from the more mainstream care and cleaning services; to the more specialized services of sex workers; doulas; therapists, beauticians, dating and relationship assistants, personal assistants, trainers and shoppers. One of the defining features of neoliberal capitalism has been the transformations that have occurred to labor and life, in which the male breadwinner and his `non-working housewife have been replaced with new and differently problematic ideals. In this course we will consider how the proliferation of commodified forms of reproduction has had a profound effect on where such work takes place and how the expansion of markets has also disrupted previously naturalized discourses of what can and ought to be bought and sold.",FSCT 202
Entrepreneurial Leadership,"As technology and globalization continue to spur interconnectedness, leaders must navigate tumultuous environments where change is rapid, discontinuous and unpredictable. Innovation, ingenuity and an ability to add value by solving problems are necessary. This course will examine the attributes required of successful entrepreneurs in contemporary leadership roles. Students will learn how to take an idea to impact. They will consider important concepts, such as ethics, sustainability, economic Darwinism, and managing uncertainty. They will discuss product invention, service implementation, economic choice, risk and return, scale and scope, value creation, and small business generation.

The Age of Dictators,"European one-party dictatorships that used state organs to mobilize mass support and unleash unprecedented levels of coercion and terror directed at their own populations still haunt our memory and understanding of the 20th century. This course examines and compares the origins and dynamics of Stalin's Soviet Union, Mussolini's Italy, and Hitler's Germany, and their ways of securing popular support and eliminating opposition.

Plants and Empire,"After the 15th century, European empires dramatically transformed the geographical distribution of plants with enormous social, economic, cultural and biological consequences. The plantation system was a new form of economic enterprise dedicated to the production of a single cash crop usually brought from elsewhere such as sugar, tobacco, or cotton grown for distant markets. European administrators and merchants developed international trade in stimulants such as coffee and tea, medicinal plants such as cinchona bark (quinine), dye plants such as indigo, narcotics such as opium, food crops such as wheat and garden plants such as tulips and tree peonies. Students trace the globalization of traffic in plants and its consequences from Columbus to contemporary debates over genetically modified crops and bioprospecting. (Linton)",HIST 286
Japan Before 1868,"This course explores the Japanese past since the Paleolithic age to the late nineteenth century. It examines the lives of early settlers on the archipelago, the establishment of the Yamato court, and aristocratic and warrior rule, the sixteenth century unification of Japan, and the pacification of the realm under the Tokugawa government. We will explore various aspects of Japanese state and society, such as politics, economy, ideology, as well as their interaction with the environment and cultures around them.

The class also problematizes these changes by exploring dispute resolution and extra-judicial violence.",HIST 297
Exploring Modern China,"This course explores ""modern China"" and what it means to study it as history. Topics under examination include the fate of the ""Chinese"" imperial system as foreign elements penetrated the Sino-centric world order and ""Chinese"" efforts to establish a viable ""modern"" nation state following the Qing demise. Throughout the semester, we will pay particular attention to the notions of ""modern"" and ""Chinese,"" and whether these two terms are useful in understanding the historical experiences of the people of what we know as ""China"" today. (Yoshikawa)",HIST 298
Seminar: Race and Violence in American History,"American society emerged, at least in part, through the labor of slavery, the ""removal"" of Native Americans from the western frontier, and from Chinese aid in building the Transcontinental Railroad. The nations' promise of freedom and equality came to fruition alongside a legacy of the Ku Klux Klan, Jim Crow, and the struggles of the Modern Civil Rights Movement. As such, a full understanding of the history of America requires an examination of the centrality of race and racial violence in the American experience. This course is not designed to make heroes, villains or victims out of those involved, but rather to raise questions concerning the role that various acts of racial violence played in shaping American culture and society. Did concepts of race lead to the brutality of slavery, or was racism a consequence of this abusive system? Did preconceived ideas of difference and ""savagery"" create conditions for western expansion? How did concepts of race determine who would be included or excluded from various segments of society, and in what ways was violence used to control those deemed the other? These questions and more will be addressed through the use of a variety of texts and films throughout the semester.",HIST 300
The Enlightenment,"Many people in the West no longer believe in the divine rights of monarchs or the literal meanings of ancient religious texts, but find meaning in civil society, material life, and science, and uphold the sanctity of human equality, which they experience through relatively unrestrained access to various news media, conversations held in accessible social spaces, and schooling premised on the belief that education and experience shape the human mind. How responsible is the 18th-century movement of rigorous criticism and cultural renewal known as ""the Enlightenment""? Students examine its coherence as a movement, its major themes and proponents, its meaning for ordinary people, its varied interpretations, its spread throughout Europe and beyond, and the more sinister cultural institutions and projects that many Enlightenment figures were reluctant to interrogate.

Showa Through the Silver Screen,"Showa (1926-1989), the reign of Hirohito, is most often associated with Japan's plunge into multiple wars, its occupation by a foreign nation, and its economic recovery to become the second largest economy in the world. Less explored is Showa as the heyday of Japanese cinema. While motion pictures were first introduced to Japan in the late 19th century, domestic production only took off in the 1920s to the 1930s. Following the Asia-pacific Wars, Japanese film gained worldwide popularity in the 1950s and 1960s with directors such as Kurosawa Akira, Ozu Yasujiro, and Mizoguchi Kenji gaining international recognition. By the end of Showa, Japanese cinema was in decline as other forms of entertainment overshadowed movie going and a massive recession affected the film industry. This course explores the history of the Showa period using films as artifacts of Japanese perspectives into their state and society and the Japanese role in the Asia-Pacific region and the world.

The accounting techniques covered will include: accounting terminology; the accounting equation; how to prepare and analyze financial statements (the balance sheet, income statement, and statement of cash flows): operational costing considerations; cost behavior and cost-volume-profit analysis; differential analysis and product pricing; and budgeting. The statistical concepts which will be covered include: data collection; basic measures of summarizing data; presenting data in tables and charts; hypothesis formulation and testing; sampling techniques; normal distributions; and simple regressions techniques.",ENTR 201
Social Innovation for the Entrepreneur,"This course considers the two convergent streams of conceptual thought, activity, and impact associated with the emerging field of social innovation and entrepreneurship. First, we will discover who are social entrepreneurs defined as change agents and pioneers of social innovation. We will together try to understand the knowledge, courage, hope, dreams, personalities, cognition thought-patterns, behaviors, strategies, processes, and acumen of today's social entrepreneurs. Second, this understanding leads to our thinking about the application of entrepreneurship principles to social issues. Furthermore, the uniqueness of the nonprofit form in relationship to government and commercial enterprises is acknowledges, so that students may learn of the importance of social enterprise. Social enterprise- the second major stream of content for the course-utilizes earned income strategies to serve social missions. Students will explore, debate, and question whether purpose and profit can go together.",ENTR 220
Capstone,"Students in this senior capstone experience will identify and tackle real-life challenges in the social, economic and global environment using skills developed in other courses in the minor (and likely from their major). Capstone projects could include the development and launch of a product, service or organization (for-profit or non-profit). Projects will be required to demonstrate positive social and environmental impact regardless of legal structure. Students will be required to pitch their ideas for social, environmental, or economic innovation to HWS and local community experts. They will use this feedback to ensure their ideas and subsequent innovations have lasting community impact. This course will provide students with opportunities to think systematically and critically to identify and analyze real-world social, environmental, and economic issues. It will provide students with opportunities to brainstorm and construct sustainable and responsible solutions. This course not only focuses on the economic processes and outcomes (e.g., wealth generations and job creation) of entrepreneurship; but also, it explores other domains and bottom lines (e.g., social, environmental, etc.) that must be addressed for the betterment of our world and our diverse societies. Students will be challenged to discover where they fit in regarding bettering our world and society.",ENTR 400
Seminar: U.S. Civil War,"This seminar-style course is a follow up to History 235, exploring in greater depth and complexity the causes and outcomes of the American Civil War. Some questions we may consider: Why did the War begin? What role did slavery's expansion play? How did Americans understand the idea of ""Union""? Why did they engage in ""total war""? How did the massive casualty rate change how people experienced and understood death? How did the formerly enslaved claim power in the post-war period? Was Reconstruction a failure? Why does the Civil War continue to matter? Ultimately, we will hope to better understand why Americans went to war with themselves in the mid-nineteenth century, and how that war transformed the nation.

Rise of Industrial America,"The main theme of this course is the multiple meanings for diverse Americans of the triumph of an urban/industrial society in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The nature of industrial leadership, immigration and urbanization, and analyses of major political and social reform movements are among the topics to be covered. (Hood, <em>offered alternate years</em>)",HIST 310
20th Century America,"This course is a continuation of HIST 310. World War I and its aftermath, economic and social changes in the 1920s, interaction between politics and urbanization, the Depression, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and the New Deal are among the topics to be covered. (Hood, <em>offered alternate years</em>)",HIST 311
U.S. Since 1939,"This course surveys American history from the start of World War II to the presidency of Jimmy Carter (1977-1981), covering foreign and domestic affairs. Subjects include origins of the Cold War, diplomacy in the nuclear age, McCarthyism, the Korean War, the affluent society, the civil rights and black power movements, the Vietnam War and its consequences, youth culture in the 1960s, the womens movement, the Watergate crisis, and the dilemmas of the postwar American economy. Special attention is paid to the state of politics and the problems of studying recent historical events. (Staff)",HIST 312
Darwinian Revolution,"This course first examines the life and work of Charles Darwin focusing on the genesis of his theory of evolution and then explores the ramifications of the Darwinian revolution both for the natural and human sciences and for broader religious, cultural, and political life. The course investigates what the Darwinian revolution tells about scientific revolutions and about the use and abuse of science in the modern world. The emphasis will be on Darwinian revolution in Europe, but attention will be paid to Darwin's fate in the Americas and Asia. (Linton, <em>offered alternate years</em>)",HIST 313
Contemporary America,"This course examines the history of the United States since the mid-1970s, including diverse approaches such as political, social, economic and cultural history, as well as U.S. foreign policy. Topics discussed include the cultural shift of the 1970s, the gay rights movement, the environmental movement, the Reagan and Gingrich revolutions, new immigrants and demographic shifts, third wave feminism, the development of the internet, the two Iraq wars, the American reaction to 9/11, and the entrenchment of the red/blue state divide. Special attention is paid to the connection between cultural and political change and to the increasing diversity of American society and culture. (Staff)",HIST 315
Women's Rights Movements in U.S.,"This course examines the creation and development of women's rights movements in the United States in the 19th and 20th centuries, two centuries that witnessed the explosion of movements for women's emancipation. Students explore the social, legal, political and economic conditions of women at different historical moments along with the efforts of women (and men) to change those conditions. Women often differed about what the most important issues facing their sex were. Consequently, this course examines not only the issues that have united women, but also the issues that have divided them. Prerequisite: WMST 100 or HIST 208 or Instructor's approval. (Free, <em>offered alternate years</em>)",HIST 317
Making of the Individualist Self,"Self-consciousness may be one of the few human attributes that has existed outside of history and regardless of culture. But the self itself, the subject and object of self-consciousness, has been understood with enormous variation through time and across the globe. This seminar explores a very influential conception of selfhood: the ""individualist self,"" the self-driven by belief in its coherence and its own goals, set in contrast to other selves and other structures, and indebted for its origins to the major shifts that took place in western Europe in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. Attention is given to the Protestant Reformation, encounters with new and ancient worlds, and the spread of experimental science, representative government, and capitalism. Students also examine historical sources most intimately connected with this phenomenon: the written forms (diaries, autobiographies, and other self-examination exercises) through which people documented their existence and came to constitute and reflect a new mode of self-understanding and engagement with the world. (Kadane, <em>offered every three years</em>)",HIST 318
The Short Story,"This course introduces the short story genre, including attention to its history and development. Students read a broad range of examples, including at least one single-author collection or cycle. Assignments allow students to learn the fundamental skills of literary criticism through the practice of formal analysis. (Staff)",ENG 106
The Asia Pacific Wars,"This course attempts to survey the multiple memories and histories of the Asia-Pacific Wars among the people of North East Asia and the United States. We will examine changes and continuities in these views in the framework of regional politics and economy since 1945, focusing on such controversial issues as the Nanjing massacre, ""comfort women,"" Pearl Harbor, war and racism, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Smithsonian Enola Gay exhibit, and history textbooks. In the broadest context, the course explores the history of imperialism and colonialism in Asia-Pacific since the late nineteenth century and the importance of ""history"" and ""memory"" in understanding its consequences. We will be reading a variety of secondary materials.",HIST 320
Qing and Tokugawa,"In 1600, Tokugawa Ieyasu ended decades-long civil war on Japanese archipelago, ""united"" the realm, and founded the Edo (Tokugawa) period. In 1644, the Manchu overthrew the Chinese Ming dynasty and established the Qing rule. Both regimes lasted for 268 years, until 1868 and 1912. This course explores the political, social, economic, ecological, cultural, and intellectual histories of these two regimes. Through examination of major secondary sources on these topics, students will become familiar with the recent historiographical trends in the two subjects. They will also assess the relevance of comparative or parallel historical approaches when studying these two important eras in North East Asia.",HIST 324
Seminar: Medicine in Modern Europe,"This course traces the development of major ideas in a broad array of fields, including politics, religion, psychology, and history, through the Civil War era. While it focuses chiefly on formal thought, it also pays attention to trends in popular culture and to the social context. It relies heavily on primary source readings, a number of which are literary in character. Some questions examined involve the relationship between intellectual and social change, the distinctiveness of American thought, and the role of an intellectual elite in a democratic society. (Linton, <em>offered alternate years</em>)",HIST 325
Central America and the U.S.,"This seminar will investigate massive human rights violations, their documentation's, and the peace process in Central America in the second half of the twentieth century, with a special focus in the role of United States' intervention. During the Cold War, no region in the world was more integrated into the security strategy and political economy of the United States that was Central America, and nowhere did the transformation of U.S. foreign policy from the principle of national self-determination to overt military and economic imperialism ring clearer. At the same time, no region in the world experienced more egregious and violent crimes against human rights than, in particular, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Nicaragua. While these governments actively thwarted and violently suppressed democratic social movements, revolutionary forces, and regimes committed to social justice, the United States used civil conflicts in the region as a pretext for intervention, and actively aided in their escalation. That said, the U.S. government's support for brutally repressive regimes in Central America also generated a powerful humanitarian response both within the United States and in the international community. Finally, this course will examine how humanitarian instruments and organizations sought to uncover the truth about human rights abuses, negotiate peace, and, less successfully, implement justice in Central America. Prerequisites: At least one course in Latin American studies or cross-listed, or instructor permission. (Ristow, <em>Spring, offered alternate years</em>)",HIST 327
Law in Africa,"Contemporary African legal systems combine many different forms of law, from precolonial ""customary law"" to sharia to constitutions that explicit protect human rights. The legal systems of some countries contain all three of these types of law, and more. In this class, we will explore the roots of Africa's legal pluralism. We will analyze the way that precolonial systems of ""customary law"" were changed by European colonization, the writing of African constitutions during decolonization, the spread of Islamic law, and the development of new forms of international law such as the International Criminal Court.",HIST 331
Slavery in Africa,"Between 1525 and 1875, more than 12.5 million Africans departed the continent as part of the trans-Atlantic slave trade. How did this massive forced migration change the continent? Why did some African rulers participate in the slave trade? How did the trans-Atlantic slave trade change the institution of slavery in Africa itself? Did the trans-Atlantic slave trade contribute to later forms of political instability in Africa? In this class, we will trace the political, social, economic, and cultural impact to the rise and fall of the trans-Atlantic slave trade on the African continent.",HIST 332
Pre-Modern Mediterranean,"This course explores the primary sources of the pre-modern Mediterranean world and how historians have used these texts to compose histories of the Middle Ages and understand the present. Topics include medieval biography, the relationship between science and history, Norman history writing and language, and medieval travel writing.",HIST 334
Literary Science Fiction and Fantasy,"This course will begin with a survey of the origins of science fiction and fantasy, the development of the genres in the post-Enlightenment era, and twentieth-century trends, but its main focus will be the relationship between mainstream literary fiction and science fiction/fantasy, and the ultra-contemporary trend of crossover between the two. We will consider the relationship between science and the genres, the exile of science fiction from canonical literature, and what the increasing openness of literary writers and academic circles might mean. Readings may include: Evans, The Wesleyan Anthology of Science Fiction; Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings; Herbert, Dune; Miville, The City and the City; VanderMeer, City of Saints and Madmen; Mitchell, Cloud Atlas; Lethem, Chronic City; Link, Magic for Beginners. (Conroy-Goldman)",ENG 108
Partial Magic,"In the second half of Don Quixote, Don Quixote meets characters who have read the first half of the novel. That would include us. Lewis Carol describes a map of England which represents everything in England, which would include the map, and on that map, a map of the map, and so on into infinity. In this course we will explore these disconcerting examples of what we are calling partial magic, in both literature and the visual arts, in an effort to see that they are not unusual, but are in fact, fundamental to the way art endeavors to immerse us in its world. We will also consider the consequences of this immersion. In what sense is what Coleridge called the willing suspension of disbelief, a loss of our critical faculties? In what sense is art related to propaganda and advertising? (Holly)",ENG 110
Experience of War in Literature,"We will read in the literature of war from one of its earliest representations, <em>The Iliad</em>, all the way through verse and film that address the realities of post-9/11 warfare. We will read chronologically and consider, after Homer, the nineteenth century Napoleonic warfare in <em>War and Peace</em>, the especial traumas of WWI and WWII, and late twentieth and twenty-first century warfare of the Vietnam conflict and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Special attention will be paid to the experience of soldiers, male and now female, civilians and nurses, to the ethos, psychologies, ideologies and bureaucracies that drive warfare, and to the efforts of writers to capture the toll taken by those experiences. Texts may include <em>The Iliad</em>, sections of <em>War and Peace</em>, <em>All Quiet on the Western Front, Catch-22, Slaughterhouse Five, The Things They Carried</em>, <em>Billy Lynn's Long Half-Time Walk, Redeployment</em>. (Weiss)",ENG 111
"Sickness, Health, and Disability","This course explores narrative techniques and representational strategies and other literary representations of illness, health, and various forms of disability (cognitive, physical, emotional, and so forth). Through readings from different genres and from different periods and cultures, we will examine, critique, and deconstruct the ways in which sickness, health, and disability--as well as normalcy--are defined in literary and cultural contexts, and how these definitions often intersect with definitions of and assumptions about race, class, gender, sexuality, morality, criminality, and other markers of citizenship and identity. (Cope)",ENG 114
Literature and Social Movements,"Can books change the world? In the U.S., readers of slave narratives and Stowe's novel <em>Uncle Tom's Cabin</em> were swayed to the abolitionist cause. The counterculture went <em>On the Road</em> with Kerouac. Second-wave feminists clutch copies of <em>The Bell Jar</em>, while anti-Vietnam War protestors were fluent in Heller and Vonnegut. Ayn Rand's fiction has been a powerful force for new conservatives, while Malcolm X's autobiography helped radicalize the Civil Rights movement. And why were Occupy protestors wearing masks made famous by a graphic novel? This course considers how literature has shaped and been shaped by social movements. Weaving together contextualizing historical readings and primary documents with poetry, memoir, novels, and other literary forms, students will investigate the relationships between revolution and the word.

Black Women in the Struggle for Rights in America: from Phillis Wheatley to Black Lives Matter,"Black Women in the Struggle for Rights in America: from Phillis Wheatley to Black Lives Matter From the founding of the United States, the concept of rights and citizens bearing those rights were understood to be a central part of American democracy and belonging. And yet, not all people  in the nation were accorded rights. For example, the right to vote, serve on juries, and travel were reserved almost exclusively for property-owning white males. Indeed it is not a stretch to say that the next two hundred years of American history can be seen as a struggle to expand both the scope of and access to those rights. Many courses examine the history of rights form the standpoint of white people (men and/or women), black men, or workers. Borrowing from the insights of theses perspectives, this course examines the contributions that black women have played in shaping the struggle for rights in the changing political, social, and cultural contexts of the United States from the eighteenth through twenty-first centuries.",HIST 348
"Wealth, Power and Prestige","Exercising power that is entirely disproportionate to their small numbers, elites have shaped American society by making political and economic decisions and by influencing cultural values. This seminar explores the history, social composition, and power of elites in American history by asking questions such as: What groups should be considered elites? Who belongs to elites, who doesn't, and why? How have the makeup and authority of elites changed in U.S. history? How do elites use power and understand themselves and their roles? How do elites seek to legitimate themselves in a society that prizes democracy and that, since the mid-20th century, has increasingly valued egalitarianism? What is the importance of elites for social inequality, economic growth, and race, ethnicity, and gender? How are changing understandings of rank, class, wealth, and equality reflected in the cultural realm, especially in the ""self-help"" literature? How is opposition to elites expressed politically and culturally? (Hood, <em>offered alternate years</em>)",HIST 352

Fate of Socialism,"This course studies Marxian Socialism as a product of history, as a lens through which to view past, present and future history and as a shaper of history. After introduction to the fundamentals (only) of Marx's thought, students examine how those ideas played out during the great 20th century revolutions in Russia and China. Finally, students spend a few weeks thinking about uses of socialism today in a possibly Post-Marxian world. (McNally, <em>offered alternate years</em>)",HIST 396
The History of Original Sin,"What is the relationship between changing views of human nature and major historical transformations?Do the former mold or reflect the latter - or both? Or does asking the question in those terms miss the point?Are changing theories of human nature themselves the essence rather than the cause or consequence of epochal shifts? This course considers these and related questions by examining the history of the Christian doctrine of original sin. For much of the last two millennia, original sin has been the most persuasive way of capturing the view that people are flawed by nature and unfixable by their own means. That idea drove St. Augustine's influential vision of Christianity, and returning to Augustine on this very point a thousand years later (and five hundred years ago) led to conceptual breakthrough of the Protestant Reformation. Rejecting original sin and its corresponding view: the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, and other ideological shifts behind the great Atlantic revolutions. And insofar as belief in original sin defines evangelicalism, much as pessimism about human nature that is traceable to original sin still underpins a strain of conservative thought, this Christian doctrine continues to haunt ideological division.",HIST 431
Seminar: Civil Rights,"This course will examine the civil rights movement. Rather than focusing only on the most well-known events of the 1950s and 1960s, this course will cover what scholars call the long civil rights movement, from the rise of the New Negro during World War I to the Rainbow Coalition of the 1980s to the Black Lives Matter Movement of the early twenty-first century.",HIST 462
Seminar: Civil War in American Memory,"Since the end of the Civil War Americans have sought to better understand the brutal struggle that divided families, neighbors and regions. Through the veterans' parades and public statues of the late 1800s, the films and novels of the early 1900s, the intensely impassioned debates about the Confederate battle flag of the 1990s, and the battle reenactments today, Americans have ""remembered"" the Civil War in varied ways, thereby assigning meanings to the conflict. This class explores these diverse meanings, interrogates why this particular moment in American history continues to fascinate and enrage Americans, and examines the complicated relationship between American history, memory, and culture. Prerequisite: Instructor's approval or HIST 235. (Free, <em>offered alternate years</em>)",HIST 471
Britain: Industry and Empire,"This course examines the period of Britain's global supremacy, roughly from the beginning of the eighteenth century to the end of the nineteenth. The particular focus here is on industrialization and the growth of empire. But in order to see how these processes transformed the British Isles, this course will also consider party politics, gender relations, and some of the major themes of cultural history.

Shakespeare on Screen,"So far as we can tell, Shakespeare's plays were written for the stage rather than for the page. In other words, they were meant to be experienced in an embodied public performance of sights and sounds, rather than read silently and in solitude. In this introduction to Shakespeare's work, we will draw upon the rich archive of Shakespeare on film to study six of his most influential plays in multiple performances, exploring how different directors brought these plays to life in different ways, working in a new medium and within different social and political contexts in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. (Carson)",ENG 136
American Revolutions,"From Declaration of Independence to the Declaration of Sentiments, America's revolutionaries and reformers have written their own literature. This course will explore the history of politics and culture in the United States from the American Revolution to the Civil War. We will study the work of writers who were for the rights of women and against the removal of Indians from their lands, who were for the liberation of enslaved people of African descent and against the use and abuse of alcohol. We will also read the writings of the early labor and environmental movements. Like the figures we study, we will experiment with different forms to express our ideas and arguments.",ENG 152
Introduction to African American Literature I,"We begin with a slave narrative from the nineteenth century, but this course concentrates on African American narratives of the twentieth century, from the Harlem Renaissance through the ""protest"" novel and black nationalism to black women writers. Students focus on a central concern of the African American traditions, the tension between the political and the aesthetic. Students pay attention to both the aesthetic properties of the literary text and to its political dimensions. In addition to the concerns with race, class, gender, and sexuality, students examine the intricate set of intertextual relations between different writers which constitute the tradition of African American writing.

Global English Literature,"What comprises global English literature? Colonialism was not only an economic, but a cultural, technological, linguistic, and demographic phenomenon. Movements of westerners to colonial spaces evoked counter-movements of people from around the globe traveling to the west. These flows resulted in a new body of literature in western languages written by people from other parts of the globe. In this course students will study examples of this world literature written in English. Readings will typically include works from Africa, the Caribbean, Asia, and the Indian subcontinent. In order to consider how these literatures have been influenced by western aesthetic values and forms, and how might they, in turn, transform and reinvent western traditions, students may also study key narratives from England and/or the United States. Following decolonization movements of the mid-twentieth century, the study of these diverse literatures spawned key terms such as postcolonialism, globalization, diaspora, transnationalism, alterity, and so on; these concepts will also be part of the course. Throughout these literary works, students will find characters who must continue to live with the alien and alienating legacies of colonialism, even in a modern and globalized world. (Basu, Ivanchikova)",ENG 170
Travel Literature,"The mobilities of populations have been crucial to the ways in which human beings have been organized across the planet - in empires, in nations, on continents, in hemispheres. Several factors encourage or deter mobility or travel - technological, economic, demographic, and so on. But travel inevitably introduces an encounter with otherness. We begin and end the course with an encounter with America. We will encounter embodiments of racial and gendered otherness, but we will also examine the encounter between the human and the machine, the technological otherness of the android. (Basu)",ENG 175
Film Analysis I,"This course focuses on specific aspects of the filmic system and how they work. Attention is paid to detailed analyses of images and sounds and their dynamic relation to the film's narrative. The goal of the course is a keener understanding not only of the world of film, but of the increasingly visual world in which we live. The primary emphasis is on what is called the Classical Hollywood Model, the dominant (culturally, economically, ideologically) mode of filmmaking in the world today (although not the only mode). As such it is crucial for students of film and, arguably, for us all to be actively aware of its structures and assumptions. Open to first-year students only. Students who complete ENG 180 may not take ENG 280. (Lyon)",ENG 180
From Novel to Film,"Film today is in a position in our culture analogous to the position the novel once held in literary tradition. It is still largely a medium that belongs to popular culture, and its sense of emotional immediacy, the persuasive power of visual storytelling, and filmmakers' ability to respond to current ideas and trends of thought often means that modern film is a useful window on the age in which a film is made. We will address narrative technique, ask how filmmakers use the visual medium to transform difficult but profoundly arresting narratives into engaging and comprehensible films, while also asking what makes an adaptation effective? Why bother if the book is satisfying? Can an adaptation ever be as good as the book? There is another focus here as well; we also want to raise important questions about how and by whom meaning is made in both novels and films and about the role of the imagination of the reader and viewer in completing the picture. Readings and films may vary. (Minott-Ahl)",ENG 185
Creative Writing for First-Years and Sophomores,"This course offers introductory techniques in the writing of both fiction and poetry.

Required books include core reference texts in the discipline and will be supplemented by individual professors. (Staff)",ENG 200
The Lyric,"This is a course about The Secret of Poetry. That secret has everything to do with the powers of language and what those powers are being harnessed to do. The premise of this course is that there is something about the use of language in lyric poetry that sets it apart from other forms of language-use. We will begin the course by considering the concept of mimesis as a way to begin discovering that secret and understanding how it is enacted. In this course we will try to get fix on what lyric poetry really is. Is it poetry that aspires to the condition of music, for example? And if it is, why? If ""a poem is not the record of an event but the event itself,"" as Robert Lowell put it, how is that possible; that is, what makes that possible? We'll explore the way poetry doesn't refer to experience but incarnates it. Texts include Ovid's <em>Metamorphoses</em>, the odes of John Keats, and the poems of Gerard Manley Hopkins, Randall Jarrell, Marianne Moore, Denise Levertov, George Herbert, among others.

Topics in Francophone Cultures,"This course seeks to introduce the variations of French and the variety of cultures in the Francophone the world. Students are introduced to the concept of Francophone, its ideological and political meaning as well as its cultural and literary expressions. Students discover the unity and the diversity of French-speaking countries. They explore contemporary issues in these countries, and discuss the relations of the Francophone world with France and the U.S. in the context of globalization. The goal of this course is not simply to acquaint students with issues and realities around the Francophone world, but to provide them with a broader cultural and intercultural perspective.

Le Midi de la France,"In this course, we concentrate on the South of France. The historian Fernand Braudel writes that ""France is diversity... it is not only an appearance, a way of speaking, but a concrete reality, the triumph of plurality, heterogeneity, of something never really seen elsewhere...of something always different..."" Similarly throughout its history, the South has been shaped by a constant flux of immigrants. Its luminous landscape reflects this diversity from rugged and dry terrains, mountains and the Mediterranean coast. It has been the site of many political and religious upheavals which are embedded in its cities and landscapes. It is difficult to look at the South without ""seeing"" its history unfold. Since medieval times, poets, writers and artists have been inspired by its landscapes. We will look at the history, language, literature, and arts of the South by following different itineraries marked by cities such as Marseille, Montpellier, Toulouse, Aix-en-Provence. We will study its rich folklore and traditions, and taste its fragrant cuisine. Prerequisites: FRE 227, or permission of the instructor, or concurrently with FRE 227.

"Introduction to French Literature I: Mystics, Friends and Lovers","The conventions governing erotic love and passion in Europe were first formulated by the troubadours in Southern France. This course traces the evolution of passionate love from the Middle Ages to the Present, and analyzes its connections with mystical love. We will also study other traditions of love such as marital love and friendship. Prerequisite: Any two 240 level courses, or permission of the instructor, or a 240 level with another 240 level taken concurrently. (Wells, <em>offered alternate years</em>)",FRE 251
"Introduction to French Literature II: ""Que Sais-Je?""","This course is an introduction to literary discourse and a study of essays by significant authors who have shaped French thought from the Renaissance to the present. The question `Que sais je?' is an epistemological question, that is, a question about knowledge. What we know, or think we know, shapes our vision of the world, and who we are. The subject determines the object of knowledge. We pay particular attention to the subject, the ""je"" of the question. We consider the subject's position before the unknown, and the other. Our journey, beginning with Montaigne's question about identity will lead naturally to analysis of contemporary Western attitude toward others. Prerequisite: Any two 240 level courses, or permission of the instructor, or a 240 level with another 240 level taken concurrently. (Gallout, <em>offered regularly</em>)",FRE 252
Introduction to French and Francophone Literatures III: Paris-Outre-mer,"Depending on the instructor, this course follows various trajectories between Paris and Francophone countries and regions around the world. Students listen to voices in French from outside France. Paris is considered a starting point, rather than the center of Francophone cultures. Special attention is given to the ambiguous love-hate relations between France and other Francophone countries. This course teaches explication de texte, the French approach to reading literary and other cultural texts. Prerequisite: Any two 240 level courses, or permission of the instructor, or a 240 level with another 240 level taken concurrently. (Koffi-Tessio, <em>offered alternate years</em>)",FRE 253
Middle Ages and Renaissance,"Topics include Medieval epic and romance, Medieval and Renaissance lyric poetry, Montaigne, Rabelais, The Pliade poets, Women in the French Renaissance. Prerequisites: FRE 251 and FRE 252, or permission of the instructor, or concurrently with another 250 level. (Wells, <em>offered regularly</em>)",FRE 383
Narrative Analysis,"What are stories made of? How does their structure and design influence what they can mean and how they are told? This course is an introduction to critical thinkers who have attempted to answer these questions. In addition to working through some fundamental theories about narrative (what it is and how it works), we will also apply what we've learned to some representative texts. Students will come away knowing how point-of-view, temporality, character representation, fictionality, and closure are not only critical to the way stories are told: they radically determine what these stories mean and how we interpret them. (Ivanchikova)",ENG 205
Environmental Literature,"In this course students read poetry and prose by writers who concern themselves with the human experience of and relation to nature. These diverse writers artfully evoke the landscape while at the same time contemplating the modern environmental crisis. They approach the question of the meaning of nature in our lives in personal, as well as philosophical and ethical, ways. Cross-listed with Environmental Studies.",ENG 213
Victorian Poets,"The poets of the nineteenth century lived in an age of rapid change, as well as the questioning and re-thinking of once-established truths. They saw themselves as participants in the collective (though not-always concerted) effort of their age to make sense of their changing world and influence the direction their society would take in politics, religion, morality, and art, to name a few areas of concern. This course introduces students to the works of well-known Victorian poets, such as Alfred Tennyson, Elizabeth Robert Browning, and W. B. Yeats. It will also focus on Thomas Hardy, Charles Dickens, and Charlotte Bront, writers we are accustomed to think of as novelists. (Minott-Ahl)",ENG 214
Medieval Drama,"This course offers a panorama of Medieval dramatic genres. It surveys works from the tenth to the fifteenth centuries. The stylistic diversity includes the sadomasochistic plays of the Saxon canoness Hrotsvit of Gandersheim, the proto-opera form of Hildegard of Bingan, some English mystery plays from different cycles and a selection of French sexual farce. The study is based on both historicist and formalist critical analysis and on occasional classroom performance. (Erussard)",ENG 233
Shakespeare: Comedies,"An introduction to Shakespeare, focusing in particular on seven of his best-known comedies. We will adopt a myriad-minded approach to our readings: sometimes we will read the plays historically, paying particular attention to the ways in which plays offer us insight into the early modern English culture that produced them (and vice versa); at other times we will focus on them theatrically, exploring their dramaturgical choices, or else poetically, examining their literary aesthetics on the page; and at other times still we will attend to their politics, especially with respect to their handling of questions of gender, sexuality, class, race and ethnicity. (Carson)",ENG 236
Shakespeare: Tragedies,"An introduction to Shakespeare through his five best-known tragedies: Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, and Macbeth. We will approach these plays from a wide variety of critical angles, so that the course will not only provide a survey of Shakespearean tragedy but also offer a survey of contemporary critical methodologies. (Carson)",ENG 237
Eighteenth Century Literature and Art,"This course offers a topology of desire in the 18th century as it manifests itself in literary, architectural, and graphic productions. This course pays special attention to fantasies of power; architectural fantasies and imaginary landscapes; the oppositions of Gothicism and Classicism; the garden and the city; the sublime and the beautiful; and the relationship of the teleology of desire to narrative form. (Holly, offered alternate years)",ENG 239
English Romantic Poets,"This course is a comprehensive look at Romanticism and its proponents, its aesthetic context and the charged political environment in which it developed and thrived. The poets of this movement saw themselves thinkers and as agents of important change in the world. The poems they wrote were magic spells, meant to unleash the power of imagination and speak new political and intellectual realities into being. In addition to reading the works of well known Romantics such as Wordsworth and Byron, the course examines the provocative writings of abolitionists, visionaries, and poets whose support of Revolution in France made them distrusted at home in England. (Minott-Ahl)",ENG 241
Victorian Literature,This course investigates origins of the modern world view as anticipated and expressed in nineteenth century English literature: the breakdown of traditional religious beliefs; the alienation and isolation of the individual; changing attitudes about nature; the loss of communication; the role of education; and the affirmation of art. (Minott-Ahl),ENG 242

The Literature of Decadence,"This course offers an exploration of the phenomenon of decadence in its literary aspect, characterized primarily by the pursuit of heightened experience (sensory and imaginative) in the face of the social and ethical constraints of late nineteenth and early twentieth century European culture. Although our primary emphasis will be on the phenomenon of literary decadence in English, we will read a number of seminal French texts (in translation) and discuss a number of European painters and composers by which late nineteenth century English writers were inspired. We will explore the ways in which decadence can be situated historically in terms of such broader social and cultural phenomena as imperialism, poverty, the emergence of the metropolis, the emergence of socialism, the establishment of commodity capitalism, the ""advent"" of feminism and the New Woman, and debates about sexuality. (Cope)",ENG 246
Topics in XVIIth and XVIIIth Centuries,"Topics include from d'Artagnan to the Sun King: Power and Culture in the XVIIth century; Narrative fiction; Epistolary Narratives; Representations of the Other in the Ancient Rgime. Prerequisites: FRE 251 and FRE 252, or permission of the instructor, or concurrently with another 250 level. (Gallout, <em>offered regularly</em>)",FRE 384
Topics in XIXth to XXIst Centuries,"Topics might include an analysis of gender, class and race in short stories, and novels by Stendahl, Flaubert, Zola, women's writings of the XXth century, as well as a study of poets such as Nerval, Claudel, Bonnefoy and Saint-John Perse and Victor Segalen.

The Troubadours,"This course introduces students to the texts, music, and culture of the troubadours of medieval Southern France-and their legacy as the inventors of love poetry in the vernacular. Performing their songs in the most powerful and vibrant cultural centers of medieval France. The Troubadours sang the praises of their beloved, incited kings to war, accused the decadence and corruption of the ruling classes, and made the vernacular an accepted medium for religious expression. But who were the troubadours? In this class, students are introduced to the language, history, religion, geography, and culture of these poets. Through the study of printed texts, CD recordings, digital images of medieval manuscripts, and artistic representations, students will learn about the origins of the troubadour lyric as live musical performance, its later transformation into written text, and the troubadours' impact on other cultures and literary traditions. Readings (and CD/MP3 recordings): the troubadours, some texts of the Northern French trouvres, and occasional relevant readings in literature of other periods and traditions.",FRNE 285
Irish Literary Renaissance,"This course is designed as a sustained and extensive study of the major texts (poetic, novelistic, dramatic, essayistic) of the ""Irish Renaissance"" and an Irish Modernism in which thematic concerns with cultural and political nationalism converged with an abiding interest in radical forms of literary experimentation. We will look at these texts in terms of what Seamus Deane has called ""Irish Renaissances"": those periods of Irish literary flourishing that both inspired and were inspired by Irish Modernism. (Cope)",ENG 247
"Country, City, Colony: The Modern British Novel","This course will consist of an exploration of the development and transformation of the British Novel in the late 19th and early 20th Centuries as exemplified by the work of three British writers. Our emphasis will be on the ways in which definitions of British culture and identity were reflected by these novelists' representations of the city, the country, and the colony, and the colony as the defining social and geographical features of the British Empire. We pay close attention to the ways in which race, class, gender, and other markers of social difference and inequality are represented and redefined in these novels as the opportunities and encroachments of Modernity--increased social and geographical mobility, the emergence of commodity Capitalism, first-wave Feminism, colonial exploration and exploitation, World War--radically transform the social and cultural landscape of Britain, Europe, and the world as a whole. Novelists may include: Joseph Conrad, Thomas Hardy, D.H. Lawrence, Jean Rhys, Virginia Woolf. (Cope)",ENG 248
Early American Literature,"This course surveys the development of U.S. literature up to and including the Civil War period. Literary works will be analyzed in terms of both their textual qualities and the social contexts that produced them. Readings may include Whitman, Dickinson, Thoreau, Hawthorne, Melville. Not open to students who have taken ""American Literature to Melville."" (Staff)",ENG 250
Nineteenth-Century American Fiction,"What's so great, or so American, about the Great American Novel? To answer this question, we will read a number of novels from the period-the nineteenth -century-in which the idea of the G.A.N. (as Henry James, whose own works contended for that title, abbreviated it) was first introduced. We will also discuss historical shifts in literary valuation that would cause Harriet Beecher Stowe's <em>Uncle Tom's Cabin</em>, the nominee of the critic who first came up with the idea, to be supplanted by Herman Melville's <em>Moby Dick</em> as the Great American Novel. In addition to Stowe and Melville, we may read fiction by writers like Nathaniel Hawthorne, Mark Twain, Charles Chestnutt, and Sarah Orne Jewett.",ENG 251
American Women Writers,"This course focuses on a selection of women writers who have made important contributions to U.S. literature. Authors, genres, and periods will vary depending on the instructor's area of interest and expertise. (Creadick)",ENG 252
Nineteenth-Century American Poetry,"American poetry from the nineteenth-century can both seem too much of its own time and way ahead of its time. Poets like Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson are, in their own ways, entirely exceptional and wholly representative of verse written before the Modernist Movement. This course will explain why. In addition to spending about half of the term on Whitman and Dickinson, the course will treat the work of a dozen other poets, black and white, who worked in as many different forms. We will read authors who are better known for their prose (Poe, Melville), authors who were popular in their time but have since fallen our to critical favor (Longfellow, Whittier), and a large group of women writers who were described, and were often dismissed, as poetesses. We will also read prose-like Emersons essays, Poes articles, Whitmans prefaces, and Dickinson's letters-that will help us understand them. Together, they will demonstrate for us the diversity of writers and writings from this period. (Staff)",ENG 254
Modern American Literature,"This course surveys American Literature written during the first half of the twentieth century, from the Civil War to the 1940s. Focusing on the novel, we will trace the overlapping literary movements of this era, including realism, naturalism, and especially modernism. We will chart the personal, social, and political forces (such as industrialization, immigration, war, feminism, urbanization, depression) that shaped the production and reception of these literary works. Not open to students who have taken American Literature from Crane. (Creadick)",ENG 260
Popular Fiction,"When a novel acquires a mass readership, does it lose aesthetic value? What is the difference between literary fiction and popular fiction? Focusing on a genre fiction, cult bestsellers, middlebrow blockbusters, pulp or trash fiction produced across American history, this course invites students to consider the politics of taste and hierarchies of literary value embedded in popular reading practices. Students will read these literary works alongside a number of primary and secondary texts in order to illuminate the pleasures and anxieties of reading. (Creadick)",ENG 261
Jewish American Fiction,"This course will trace chronologically the course and development of Jewish American fiction in the 20th century and survey the work of some of its great writers. We will tackle the issues of the immigrant, the outside and the condition of minority status. We will address the issues and problems around assimilation to do with identity, language, religious belief and values, class and anti-Semitism. We will address the changing experience of women in the confrontation with a new culture and with an evolving American culture. We will also examine the effects of the Holocaust on Jewish-American identity and its ramifications in the children-of-survivors generation. Authors may include Yezierska, Roth, Malamud, Bellow, Paley, Elkin, Ozick, and Shteyngart. (Weiss)",ENG 263
Modernist American Poetry,"This course is a study of selected major early twentieth century figures, including Gertrude Stein, T.S. Eliot, H. D., Jean Toomer, Ezra Pound, Marianne Moore, and William Carlos Williams. (Cowles)",ENG 266
Post WWII American Poetry,"An introduction to contemporary American poetry, this course emphasizes both the close reading of poems and the placing of recent American poetry within its social and literary contexts. Crosslisted in Womens Studies, this course also covers a number of poetic movements that investigate social justice issues. (Cowles)",ENG 267
Globalization and Literature,"Globalism as a contemporary phenomenon has been in the ascendancy. It is, among other things, an economic, cultural, technological, and demographic phenomenon. Students examine globalism and its related metaphors of hybridity, cosmopolitanism, migrancy, exile, and so on against nationalism and its privileged metaphors of rootedness and identity. If the production of a national subject is no longer the purpose of ""discipline,"" what does it mean to produce a transnational subject? These are some of the concerns of the fiction students read for this course. We typically begin with two famous American novels, Upton Sinclair's <em>The Jungle</em> and Don DeLillo's <em>White Noise</em>, to examine the impact of globalization on the United States. We then move to two South Asian novels, Salman Rushdie's <em>Midnight's Children</em> and Hanif Kureishi's <em>Black Album</em>. We end with two important novels by black women writers, Tsitsi Dangarembga's <em>Nervous Conditions</em> and Toni Morrison's <em>Tar Baby</em>. (Basu)",ENG 270
Imagining the Middle East,"This course will examine representations of the Middle East, its geography, its culture, and its peoples in literature and film. The Greater Middle East is a loosely defined geopolitical entity that extends from Pakistani-Indian border to the Northern shores of Africa. Students will learn about the region as seen and imagined through the eyes of both foreigners and natives, Western and non-Western writers, travel journalists, soldiers, bloggers, colonists, refugees, and migrants. The course will explore the stereotypes that define representations of the Middle East in the West; most specifically, we will address Edward Said's claim that the Middle East became trapped in swarm of interrelated notions he defined as Orientalism. Said insists that Orientalism is a fiction produced by the western mind and subsequently used to justify colonial exploration, validate the need for human rights interventions, while also constructing the region as a site of an exotic adventure. (Ivanchikova)",ENG 276
Film Analysis II,"This course focuses on specific aspects of the filmic system and how they work. Attention is paid to detailed analyses of images and sounds and their dynamic relation to the film's narrative. The goal of the course is a keener understanding not only of the world of film, but of the increasingly visual world in which we live. The primary emphasis is on what is called the Classical Hollywood Model, the dominant (culturally, economically, ideologically) mode of filmmaking in the world today (although not the only mode). As such it is crucial for students of film and, arguably, for us all to be actively aware of its structures and assumptions. This course is not open to students who have taken ENG 180 Film Analysis I. (Lyon)",ENG 280
Film Histories II (1930-1950),"This series of courses is conceived as a modular film histories group aimed at giving students a background in a specific historical period and/or preparation for more specialized work in a specific area of film history. Each year one module is offered, usually during the fall semester. Since it is not possible to cover all of world cinema during any of these historical periods in a single term, a selection is made to emphasize specific themes or historical events. This course may include a study of the Hollywood studio system, European and American pre-World War II and wartime cinemas (including French films of the Occupation and Italian neo-realism) and postwar European and American cinemas. (Lyon)",ENG 282
The Art of the Screen Play,"Screenplays are the blueprints of movies. In this course students read screenplays and study the films that have been made from them. Special attention is paid to such elements as story, structure, character development, and to the figurative techniques for turning written text into moving image. Prerequisite: ENG 200. (Holly)",ENG 286
Jane Austen in Film,"Because Jane Austen's novels are essentially her own, written creations and films based on them are collaborative and characterized by sound, motion, and visual detail, the two media approach narrative in fundamentally different ways. We will consider to what extent a film version of a Jane Austen novel is an entirely new work that is artistically independent of the original. We will also examine the consequences of viewing such films as translations of Austen's novels both for the filmmakers who approach their projects this way and for critics who read the films from this perspective. While we will certainly take into account the techniques employed by directors and screenwriters to create a coherent and effective narrative that captures Austen's story, it is important to note that this is not a film course. The focus here is on the interplay between two methods of storytelling that results when novels written by an author who deliberately avoids description are made into films. (Minott-Ahl)",ENG 287
Creative Writing,"This course offers introductory techniques in the writing of both fiction and poetry. The workshop format emphasizes group discussion of the writings of class members. Readings of modern authors supplement discussions of form and technique. This course is normally required as a prerequisite for fiction and poetry workshops. Prerequisite: at least one other ENG course. Not open to students who have taken ENG 190. (Conroy-Goldman, Cowles, Babbitt)",ENG 290
Cultural Theory and Popular Culture,"This course introduces cultural studies as a major area of contemporary theory which has reshaped the way we think and write about literature. Critical cultural studies, historicism, and reader-response theory have expanded understandings of literary meaning to include production and reception of those texts as well as their ideological content and consequences. Students read theoretical essays by such thinkers as Marx, Gramsci, Althusser, Foucault, White, Butler, and Baudrillard, as well as examples of scholars applying these ideas to the study of literature and other cultural forms. Students will then become the critics, applying these theories to the contemporary literary, material and popular culture texts that surround themstories, poems, film, photographs, toys, fashion, sports, and music. (Creadick)",ENG 301
Feminist Literary Theory and Criticism,"This course is designed to introduce students to feminist literary theories and critical practices that are considered to be of crucial importance in the field of feminist literary theory today. It focuses on such issues as female sexualization, representations of violence and madness, and subjectivity. During the course of the term we will read and discuss a large variety of texts and methodologies written by some of the most influential feminist theorists today. Students will also become familiarized with the context in which there texts were written and learn how these various methodologies can be applied to the study of literary works. The course is an excellent opportunity to broaden your horizons and learn about new ideas. It is also an opportunity to acquire advanced critical thinking skills through an encounter with very complex and dense texts. As a result of this course, students should be able to have a better understanding of contemporary feminist and post-feminist culture by placing contemporary cultural practices in the context of feminist intellectual tradition.",ENG 304
"Power, Desire, Literature","This course examines the relationship between power and desire as it is represented in literature. While the course will use Nietzschean, Freudian, and Marxist theories to frame our analysis of some classic literary texts by Sade and Masoch, it will also examine some more recent writers and the emergence of sadomasochism in the contemporary United States. The course questions some of the most deeply entrenched binary oppositions in Western culture such as those between subject and object, activity and passivity, domination and submission. (Basu)",ENG 310
Small Press Book Publishing: Book Contest and Acquisitions Editing,"In this course, students will help publish a book.  We will focus on small press acquisitions editing through the facilitation of Seneca Review's first biennial Deborah Tall Lyric Essay Book Contest.  The editors of Seneca Review will have narrowed down manuscript submissions to approximately 15 semi-finalists.  Over the course of the semester, students will have the opportunity both to learn about and to engage in the acquisitions editorial process by reading, discussing, and evaluating each of the semi-finalist manuscripts and by ultimately helping select five finalists.  The TRIAS resident will meet with the class several times and serve as the contest judge.  Students will work in small groups to pitch one of  the finalist manuscripts to the judge.  By engaging in the book publishing and acquisitions process, students will grapple with such questions as:  How do lyric essays and hybrid texts work in conjunction with one another in a book-length manuscript?  What makes a creative manuscript good and how do we weigh it against competing manuscripts with different strengths?  And how can we distinguish between manuscripts that cross the threshold into the realm of literary excellence and those that do not?",WRRH 328
The Architectural Novel,"This course focuses on how Sir Walter Scott, Victor Hugo, William Ainsworth, and Alexandre Dumas use fictional narrative to make sense of the realities of their age. From about 1792 to the late 1840s, when revolution was again in the air in Europe, the last remnants of feudalism in England and France, in particular, were swept away by the tides of political unrest, technological advances, and economic change. These novelists supply architecture, history, legend and landscape as the basis for understanding the events of their own present. In their novels, the gothic building becomes a point of reference for exploration of the nature of the novel itself, the relevance of medieval architecture in post-feudal societies, the vanishing of ancient buildings, landscapes, and traditions in the face economic change and industrial revolution, as well as the idea of a national art - and of nation itself. (Minott-Ahl)",ENG 340
Modernist Experiments,"Poems with footnotes, portraits in prose, characters in search of authors, manifestoes praising plastic surgery and the demolition of museums, translations from the Chinese (redacted by editors who don't know the Chinese language): these are some of things modernism is known for. In the first half of the twentieth century writers working in a variety of genres, visual artists, and musicians were convinced that the available forms of artistic expression were outmoded. Our focus: the ways they experimented with language and literary form to represent a distinctly ""modern"" experience, one that needed to accommodate the realities of world war, the ""discovery"" of the unconscious, advances in transport and communication technologies, mass production and consumption, and the rise (and fall) of empires. (Cope)",ENG 342
Archives of American Literature,"Ralph Waldo Emerson once wrote that ""language is the archives of history."" This course will explore early American history through literature. In addition to reading historical fiction, autobiography, epic poetry, and other genres that revisit and revise the past, we will investigate how researchers come to know it. In other words, we will study the theory and practice of archives. What do these literary examinations of the country's past say about its present? How is the historical record created and preserved for, and how will it be accessed in, the future? Who and what gets left out, and why does it matter? Our authors, who may include Nathaniel Hawthorne, Frederick Douglass, Lydia Marie Child, and Pauline Hopkins, will use writing to reckon with the past. And so will we. (Black)",ENG 351
"Body, Memory, Representation","We begin with a slave narrative from the nineteenth century, and we then turn to a twentieth century narrative form that has been called the neo-slave narrative. Black women writers have initiated an important line of inquiry in these reconstructions of slavery in fiction. In these texts, they represent the desires of slaves, and, at a fundamental level, the course examines the relationship between power and desire and the suggestion that desire itself cannot be evacuated of power relations. We will compare these narratives to sadomasochistic narratives and end the semester by comparing them to Masoch's Venus in Furs. (Basu)",ENG 362
Geographies of Nowhere: Mapping the Frontier,"This course examines representations of the frontier, its structure, its role in our collective imagination, and the part it played in Western colonial expansion by focusing on twentieth and twenty-first century world literature and film. A frontier is usually imagined as a place that is far away from the ""center"": it is where civilization meets wilderness and humans face nature. The frontier is thus usually a contested space, a place of tension and uncertainty. In this course, we will focus on spaces that can be called global frontiers, among them the High Arctic (Alaska and Northern Canada), the Global South (interior Africa), and the Mysterious East (Afghanistan). All these spaces are fantasy locations that we view as either uncharted territories where nothing goes on (such as the Arctic) or as all-too-chaotic locations where too much goes on (such as Afghanistan). (Ivanchikova)",ENG 370
Who Am I? Identity in World Literature,"Can stories shape our understanding of who we are and help us find our own unique place in the world? By engaging with a variety of contemporary narratives from around the globe, students will examine how personal and collective identities are constructed, expressed, and transmitted. We will talk about identity in its relationship to desire, power, asceticism, consumption, faith, and nihilism. We will consider the ways in which narratives of identity shed light on one of life's greatest mysteries - the mystery of the self. (Ivanchikova)",ENG 376
Trias Topics Workshop,"The Trias Workshop is an intensive, practice-based studio course based in the resident's genre. Students are expected to read assignments in contemporary literature, complete writing exercises, read and critically respond to other students' work, and produce a portfolio of polished, original writing. Students will be expected to attend all Trias events in the fall and to engage with the work of visiting writers. Admission to the workshop is by application only. (Trias Writer-in-Residence)",ENG 390
Advanced Poetry Workshop,"For students highly motivated to write poetry, this course offers the opportunity to study, write, and critique poetry in an intensive workshop and discussion environment. Students will produce multiple poems, write critically in response to contemporary works of poetry, and produce, workshop, and revise a chapbook-length collection of poems as a final project. Class time is divided between discussions of contemporary poetry and workshops on student writing. Prerequisite: Permission of instructor, based on writing sample. ENG 190/290 is generally required. (Cowles)",ENG 391
Lyric Essay,"HWS is the birthplace of the lyric essay. It was in the introduction to the Fall 1997 issue of <em>Seneca Review</em> that esteemed HWS professor Deborah Tall and Hobart alumnus John D'Agata gave the lyric essay its most seminal and enduring definition, which begins by characterizing the new hybrid form as ""a fascinating sub-genre that straddles the essay and the lyric poem... give[s] primacy to artfulness over the conveying of information... [and] forsake[s] narrative line, discursive logic, and the art of persuasion in favor of idiosyncratic meditation."" We will begin our course examining the essays of Tall, D'Agata, and writers published in <em>Seneca Review</em>. And in order to gain an appreciation of the lyric essay as an inherently innovative, ever-evolving, genre-busting art form, we will proceed to study a wide range of essayists. Students will both create their own lyric essays and respond critically to each other's creative work in regularly held workshops. (Babbitt)",ENG 396
Hybrid Forms Workshop,"New publication methods and technologies change art. From the printing press, to the typewriter, the record player, the camera, or the film reel, artists have used new technologies to expand our notions of art and to skirt borders of genres and media. In the advent of the Internet and digital technologies, the possibilities for expansion and experimentation have again exploded, and contemporary artists are involved in a renaissance of hybrid forms that has become bigger than the technologies that started it. Poets are using cameras and bullhorns, musicians are using kitchen utensils, translators are using languages they don't actually speak, artists are using old books and exacto knives, sculptors are using live (and not live) human bodies, film directors are using colored pencils and moth wings, dancers are using dirt and armchairs. In this creative writing workshop, the focus will be on hybrid texts that include language in some form. We'll track a strange vein of precedent for contemporary hybrid texts across decades and even centuries, we'll explore what artists and writers are producing right now, and we'll create and workshop our own hybrid texts. We'll learn new critical language for talking about such texts, and we'll participate in collaborative and guerilla art projects. Artists from outside the English Department who are interested in working with language in some way are encouraged to ask for permission, even if they have not taken ENG 290. Prerequisites: ENG 190/290 or permission of the instructor. (Cowles)",ENG 399
Shakespeare Seminar,"The Shakespeare Seminar studies a single play by Shakespeare in great depth for a full semester. We will explore the play's history in print, on stage, on screen, and in adaptation; but most of all we will focus on the history and scope of diverse critical readings that the play has inspired. Students will be encouraged to enter into the critical conversation themselves in substantial ways: they will collaborate to develop a symposium of graduate-level conference papers for the midterm, and for the final, they will produce a collection of publishable critical articles.",ENG 436
<em>Ulysses</em>,"Often considered the greatest novel of the twentieth century (and considered by some the greatest novel in history), James Joyce's <em>Ulysses</em> is also among the most difficult novels to read. At once thrilling, edifying, frustrating, baffling, bemusing, seductive, repulsive, compassionate, confounding (the list could go indefinitely), few novels have commanded the scholarly attention of James Joyce's penultimate novel. In this class, we will read the novel in terms of some of the question that have animated Joyce criticism over the past half-century: is <em>Ulysses</em> exemplary of cosmopolitan Modernism or is it a post-colonial novel? Is it an exercise in misogyny or a proto-Feminist intervention? Elitist or populist? Because the book is so relentlessly allusive, it will be necessary for us to refer to some of the literary, philosophical, and historical materials Joyce incorporated into his novel, including Irish history, Jewish history Shakespeare's <em>Hamlet</em>, the geography of Dublin, and Thomist philosophy. Although it is not necessary, students who have not already done so might wish to familiarize themselves with <em>Dubliners</em> and <em>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</em>, as well as the <em>Odyssey</em> and <em>Hamlet</em>, as these are all important foreground materials for Joyce's experiment.

Reading Faulkner,"William Faulkner (1897-1962) sits comfortably atop a hierarchy of Great American Writers. Famous for his modernist prose experimentation in such classic works as <em>The Sound and The Fury </em>or<em> Absalom, Absalom!</em>, Faulkner also boldly explored dark and disturbing themes of race and place in America through works like <em>Light in August, Go Down, Moses</em>, and <em>Intruder in the Dust</em>. But Faulkner also wrote Hollywood screenplays, wrote short stories for cash, and wrote other sorts of novelsworks of picaresque comedy, doomed romance, and potboiler noir criminality. Faulkner himself read everything, from pulps to classics, and that reading, inevitably, shaped his own writing. In this course we will read Faulkner by investigating a broader range of his literary production, from the most canonical works to the more marginalized ones. We will situate his works by incorporating a book-length critical biography of Faulkner into our reading, as well as exploring an array of literary criticism. (Creadick)",ENG 465
Representing 9/11 Wars,"Representing 9/11 Wars will interrogate the corpus of cultural texts (novels, film, memoirs, drama, travel writing) about Afghanistan that was published in the aftermath of 9/11 and the subsequent U.S. led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. By examining the frames of cultural reference, images, themes, and aesthetics that emerge in these texts, students will gain a richer understanding of the post-9/11 global novel and the place mediated wars in the global post-9/11 imaginary. Students will learn how the global novel recasts, reframes, and remediates scenes of war-induced suffering we are already exposed to 24/7 in a hypermediated world, positioning the reader as a witness to wars that are, paradoxically, both distant and close. The post-9/11 global novel exhibits a specific aesthetic sensibility that is a sedimentation of its historical context: it registers the global state of war and the proximity of distant suffering; maps cartographies of casualties; tackles the issues of scale (close-ups of the suffering body versus the large scale of the world); grapples with understanding the extent of militarization of ordinary lives as well as new configurations of power in today's world; and addresses the issues of empathy, developments in critical theory. Students will be required to write an extensive research paper on one of the topics discussed in the course.",ENG 470
Trias Tutorial,"Under the direction of the Trias Writer-in-Residence, students will work towards the production of a full portfolio of creative writing, suitable for publication or submission as a writing sample to graduate school in the field.

Earth Systems Science,"Our planet is an integrated system in which rocks, water, ice and air interact and influence each other. This applied geoscience course investigates Earth and its systems for non-majors. The course focuses on global environmental change by exploring the complex links between the geosphere (Earth's rocky surface), hydrosphere (oceans, lakes, rivers and groundwater), atmosphere and biosphere (living things). This course examines each of these ""spheres"". What are they made of? How are they structured? How do they work? How do they interact with each other? We will consider how humans manipulate Earth's system, particularly considering climate change, nutrient pollution, ozone depletion and loss of biodiversity. We recognize that the geologic past is the key to the present and future, and explore how contemporary environmental change has analogues in Earth history. This course is designed to fulfill a student's curricular goal of experiencing scientific inquiry. It does not count toward the Geoscience major.

Earth and Life Through Time,"Is Earth's current condition - with a global ocean, polar ice caps and an oxygen-rich atmosphere - an inevitable consequence of the planet's size and position in the solar system? Should we expect all such Goldilocks Planets to have the same habitable environment? Or has our planetary home been shaped by the chance events of history? This course will begin with an examination of history. What makes a system like the Earth historical? Then we will explore how scientists ask and answer questions about historical systems and understand how this method differs from the classic ""experiments"" that most students performed in science class. Finally, we will study a series of moments in Earth's history where everything really did change. These may include the origin of life, the transition to an oxygen-rich atmosphere, the origin of animals, land plants, flowering plants, dinosaurs, mammals, and consider why our species -Homo sapiens- is the last bipedal ape standing. We will consider ice ages, wandering continents, meteor impacts and titanic volcanic eruptions. We will examine episodes of mass extinction when life hit the reset button. And we will conclude with a final question: If chance events can change the course of Earth's history, can we? (Arens or Kendrick, <em>offered annually</em>)",GEO 143

Environmental Hydrology,"All the rivers run into the ocean; yet the sea is not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again (Ecclesiastes 1:7-8). Hydrology is the study of water at or near the surface of the Earth. Modern society's demand for water from surface and groundwater sources to feed industrial, agricultural, municipal, recreational and other uses typically outstrips the supply, which has become increasingly more scarce due to the environmental degradation of existing water resources by the disposal of wastes. Thus no other discipline in the geological sciences has experienced such an explosion of interest and growth in recent years. This course investigates the physical properties of water, the hydrologic cycle, surface and groundwater processes, water quality issues, and other environmental concerns focusing on the quantitative aspects of hydrology. Project-based laboratories are mostly done in the field and analyzing/modeling data in the lab. Prerequisites: CHEM 280, GEO 184 and GEO 186, or permission of instructor.

Storytelling,"Storytelling is the oldest form of teaching. Knowing how to marshal words, voice, gestures, and meaning to orchestrate an audience's imaginative experience is still an essential part of any communicator's competence, whether in leadership, peace building, religious education, teaching, or artistic performance. The scholarship concerning story and the oral tradition is hefty and interesting, and students will read from it. But the main emphasis of the course is developing skill as storytellers as students consider dozens of stories from many traditions and practice telling stories in many ways to different audiences both in and out of class. The course is intended to fulfill a performing arts goal. (Temple, <em>offered annually in the spring</em>)",EDUC 220
"Learning, Teaching, Schools, and Mathematics","Contemporary society-through the sciences, many jobs, industries, health issues, economic theories, and technologies-depends upon mathematics and quantitative literacy.

Teaching English Language Learners,"While the number of school children speaking a language other than English at home has been growing exponentially over the last few decades, their level of academic achievement has lagged significantly behind that of their language-majority peers. This course aims to contribute to preparing future teachers for working in culturally and linguistically diverse classrooms. One of its major goals is to give students a better understanding of the cognitive, linguistic, and emotional challenges involved in being schooled in a second language. In the first part of the course, therefore, through readings and discussions, students will become acquainted with some key theoretical frameworks for understanding second language and literacy development as well as sociocultural issues particularly relevant to the education of English language learners. The second major goal of the course is to provide students with pedagogical strategies for adjusting instruction to meet the needs of English language learners in the mainstream classroom. This goal will be achieved in the second part of the course, which will consist predominantly of lesson planning workshops and teaching demonstrations. The course will have a service-learning component consisting of 15-20 hours of tutoring an English language learner. (Roberson, <em>offered alternate years</em>)",EDUC 230

Athens in the Age of Pericles,"This course is a survey of the history of ancient Greece, from the earliest days to the time of Alexander the Great. At the course's center is the great age of Athenian democracy, so fertile in its influence on our own culture. Particular attention is paid to the social and political history of Periklean Athens, but we will also spend a lot of time considering the culture of Ancient Greece. The heroic Age, oral poetry, religion, philosophy, science, Athenian law, the theater, Greek sexuality, literature and architecture are all among the topics covered. The way in which the ancient Greeks thought and expressed themselves is bursting with examples to compare to contemporary times; thus, a critical examination of Ancient Greece and its heritage requires students to read a range of primary sources from ancient philosophy to biography. We begin the course with the political and social revolution that led to the rise of the city-state and then, focus our attention on life in Athens and Sparta during the fifth century B.C.E. The course then traces domestic Athens' decline under the effects of the Peloponnesian War and Macedonian imperialism. (<em>Offered every three years</em>)",CLAS 202
Alexander the Great,"In 336 BCE Alexander acquired the throne of Macedonia but thirteen years later died in Babylon. In that time, Alexander had conquered the Persian Empire, been declared the son of the God Amun of Egypt, travelled past the Indus River, and had become involved in the acculturation of ancient cultures. Although Alexander had achieved a great deal his legacy achieved even more. Alexander and his achievements offer many problems and scholars and enthusiasts have presented a multitude of interpretations. Consequently, and thankfully, a history of Alexander the Great is a wonderful entry into the world of historiography. In addition, exploring Alexander can offer us different perspectives on leadership and how, if at all, we can learn about leadership through an investigation of Alexander. Finally, reading the ancient sources inevitably provides readers with a window into what the Greeks thought about the East and the ""us"" versus ""them"" mentality that pervaded much of the Greek world. As the eminent Macedonian scholar Eugene Borza wrote, ""it was Alexander's lot that to act as a human being was to move on a vast stage, affecting the lives of countless persons in his own day and capturing the fancies of those who lived after.""

Gender and Sexuality in Antiquity,"This course investigates ancient Greek and Roman conceptions of femininity, masculinity, and sexuality. In particular, it asks the questions: What did it mean to be a woman or a man? What did the ancient Greeks and Romans think about gender or sexuality? Is there such a thing as gender or sexuality in Greco-Roman antiquity? What did the Greeks and Romans define as 'natural' when it came to men, women, gender, and sex? Is it possible for us to investigate ancient attitudes without our own attitudes interfering? What can the answers to these questions teach a modern student? Finally, how might an understanding of ancient attitudes towards men, women, gender and sexuality relate to modern debates about gender and sexuality? (<em>Offered every three years</em>)",CLAS 230

Environmental Change in the Indigenous World,"Indigenous identity, culture, community, and politics are inextricably bound to place. Place-based cultures and identities, however, may be threatened in a world increasingly connected through the spatial expansion and deeper integration of capitalist markets, the coordination and exchange of technological developments, the movement of people, ideas, language, and symbols across borders, and the extension and homogenization of modes of governance and regulation. The imagining and re-imagining of Indigenous sovereignty is thereby tied to issues of territoriality, land and resource rights, dispossession/displacement, and environmental change. In this seminar, we will critically examine the effects of global processes on Indigenous environments and on Indigenous efforts to resist and revitalize. Specifically, we will investigate key discourses of Indigenous identity formation and negotiation, neo-colonialism, sovereignty, models of nation rebuilding, sustainability, food security, and livelihoods.",ENV 309

"Eating, Killing, Loving: Our Lives with Animals","In contemporary American culture, some animals--dogs, cats, and horses, for example--are considered treasured members of our families. They are beloved, attended to with the same care we give our kin. At the same time, other animals are considered pests, to be killed as a matter of course. Others still are paired with sauces and sides to make up what we call dinner. Elsewhere and throughout history, animals (and, and in some cases, humans) have moved in and out of these categories, demonstrating that the role of animals in our lives is never settled and seldom rooted in rational decision making. Instead, we connect with animals emotionally, affectively, and culturally. This course will examine our relationship with nonhuman animal by pairing an investigation of philosophy with an exploration of animals in literature and art. In it, students will explore the histories and ethical frameworks that govern how we treat (and eat) animals, with a focus on wildlife conservation and animal agriculture's. Together, we will question how thinking with animals teaches us about how we position ourselves as humans within the world. Finally, we will consider out potential futures alongside the nonhumans with which we share the planet, particularly in light of ongoing ecological degradation and mass extinction's. Throughout the term, we will collectively question what we think we know about nonhuman animals-and ourselves.",ENV 315

Comparative and International Education,"Schools in Finland do a far better job of educating students from all corners of society than American schools, by pursuing approaches that are virtually the opposite of what policy-makers in the US are currently demanding. Research methods form comparative education can guide us as we ask what other countries do that might succeed in our own context. In recent decades the Education for All initiative has brought millions more students into the primary school classrooms of poor countries. Yet in 2013 few sixth graders in Mali could read a sentence, and of the high school seniors in Liberia who took university entrance exams, none passed. International education is the study of what the children's educational needs are in developing countries, what is being done about them, and what is working. This course is a survey of both comparative and international education, with case studies from countries with both high and low educational achievement.

Literacy,"Sixty million adult Americans are said to be functionally illiterate. So are nearly a billion other adults on the planet. In this course, we consider what these people are missing, in terms of ways of thinking and seeing the world as well as in civic and economic life. Then we will plunge into what we might do to help them. Solutions are not simple. We will need to explore the history of the English conventions of writing and spelling, the linguistic basis for reading skill, and best practices of teaching reading and writing. Since promoting literacy is a major concern of the international development community, the course will briefly consider international literacy efforts like Education for All, EGRA, and the work of CODE-Canada, and other agencies. The course is relevant to those interested in educational aspects of public policy, international development, and teaching in the schools.

Water and Energy in China,"Water and energy are at the heart of China's environmental challenges, and addressing those challenges (or failing to) has very real human and ecological implications now and in the future. This is so not only for the people of China, the most populous country on Earth, but also for the rest of the world: pollution from China's coal-fired power plants brings acid rain and heavy metals to the Koreas, Japan, and even the western US, and manufactured products (including foodstuffs) tainted with industrial toxins have made their way to store shelves around the world. Yet the roots of many of China's environmental challenges are global: just as more developed countries have outsourced many of their manufacturing activities to China, so, too, have they outsourced the pollution of water, air, soil, and bodies resulting from those activities, along with the energy and other resource demands necessary to carry them out. This course explores the challenges and opportunities of sustainability in China - from ecological, socioeconomic, and geopolitical perspectives - through a close examination of the country's water and energy resources.

These two dynasties witnessed a rapid growth in thought, government structures, literature, art and many aspects of culture. The people of this period, from emperor/empress and aristocratic elite to storytellers and courtesans, contributed to the formation of an urban culture that was the richest in the world. While Europe was still in its dark age, China's golden age established the foundations of much of Asian culture. This course explores Tang and Song contributions to the Chinese cultural heritage.

The Black Atlantic,"The concept of the ""Black Atlantic"" was created by Paul Gilroy to counteract the divisive forces of nationalism and race, which gives rise in people of African descent to a 'double consciousness'. In the Black Atlantic, we seek to understand how the conceptualization of nation/culture around ""race"" creates a double consciousness and how, in spite of this, peoples of African descent have sustained cultural links that stretch across the Atlantic, uniting Africa, Europe and the Americas. Starting with possible pre-Columbian voyages, through the Middle Passage to the return voyages of contemporary Americans to Africa, we chart these connections across time and space.",AFS 180
Myths &amp; Paradoxes,"How do we study American culture though an interdisciplinary lens? How do American ideals-such as freedom and individualism-relate to American inequalities? Is ""America"" itself a place or an idea? This introductory course in American Studies will engage a number of questions that are central to an evolving field by focusing on tensions and contradictions in American culture. Students will examine core American concepts, such as the ""American Dream,"" ""freedom and equality,"" immigration and the ""melting pot,"" as well as infrastructures like consumer culture, democracy, and national borders. The course also introduces students to American Studies methods through close interdisciplinary analysis of a variety of cultural artifacts, such as popular fiction, leisure, music, performance, propaganda or social practices.

Buddhism and Taoism Through Chinese Literature,"Buddhism and Taoism have long been two important constituent elements of Chinese culture. Their influences on Chinese elite culture, social ethics, and popular values have inspired the use of such phrases as ""The Age of Neo-Taoism"" and ""The Buddhist Age"" to characterize some periods of Chinese history. Though many Chinese intellectuals were suspicious of and even hostile towards these two religions and sometimes labeled them as ""heterodox,"" they could not deny the fact that the two teachings had become an integral part of Chinese elite and popular culture. This course is an introduction to the major ideas of Chinese Buddhism and Taoism as they were represented and interpreted in various texts and narratives. (Huang, <em>offered annually</em>)",ASN 210
Buddhism,"This course covers the rise and historical development of Buddhism in South Asia and its spread into Southeast, Central, and East Asia. Through regular writing exercises, extensive use of visual and audio materials, and some fieldwork, students will acquire a basic vocabulary for discussing the ritual practices, ethical systems, and scriptures of Buddhism (e.g., selections from the Pali Canon); situate the major branches of Buddhism in their historical and geographical contexts (e.g., Theravada in Sri Lanka, Vajrayana in Tibet, Zen in Japan); and explore important concepts in each of the traditions and locations in view of significant sociohistorical processes, events, and institutions (e.g., the interaction of Buddhists with Daoists and Confucians in China and the associations of Shinto practitioners and Buddhists in Japan).

Women in Contemporary Chinese Culture,"Are Chinese women still submissive, powerless, and silent as commonly perceived? What roles are Chinese women playing in the present-day China and international societies? These are among the oft-asked questions this course attempts to answer. By contextualizing Chinese women in pre-modern China, Republican China, and communist China, this course attempts to show their different characteristics in different periods. Special attention, however, is given to women in social and cultural settings in contemporary China. A variety of works, including history, fiction, and films are used to acquaint students with dramatic changes, multifaceted images, gender problems of Chinese women in the post-Mao era.

We begin our enquiry in the ancient world, with a survey of the Indus Valley Civilization and then explore important holy sites, religious movements, and religious reformers in classical, medieval, and modern Hinduism. Although this course is primarily concerned with Hinduism in South Asia, the ways in which Hinduism has taken root in North America (including upstate New York) are also considered through field visits to a local Hindu temple. Our investigation of Hinduism combines historical, literary, and anthropological methodologies, and weekly meetings involve close readings of important Hindu literature (e.g., Rg Veda, Upanisads, Bhagavadgita, and Ramayana) and contemporary fiction, films, and minor fieldwork. No prior knowledge of Hinduism is required. (Cerulli, <em>offered annually</em>)",ASN 214
Environment and Development in East Asia,"Rapid development in East Asia has brought prosperity to many but has also created serious environmental problems. Rivers and lakes suffer from pollution and algal blooms; water tables have dropped dramatically; farmland has been polluted by industrial chemicals and over-fertilization; and cities choke on pollution from industry and automobiles. This course explores the environmental challenges facing East Asia as well as how governments and other groups are addressing them through various approaches to sustainable development. Special emphasis is placed on China, given its regional and global importance, and the Four Little Dragons (Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and South Korea). (Magee, <em>offered Spring</em>)",ASN 215
Ghettoscapes,"More than ever, the ghetto has come to dominate the American imagination. Mainstream media has portrayed the inner city as a place of fear and to be feared. In reaction to this view, many African American and Latino writers and filmmakers have forged powerful images of community and effort. This course focuses on films and literary texts that take up the imagery of the ghetto and its role in modern American society. In addition, students consider the role of the inner city as the crucible for hip-hop culture, including its international manifestations. (Jimnez, <em>offered occasionally</em>)",AFS 200
African Voices,"The challenges to African literature described by Ngugi wa Thiong'o in his <em>Decolonising the Mind</em> form the basis for our discussions of recent African literature. Principal themes of the course then are the critique of social structures both traditional and colonial, the position of women, modalities of resistances, and the exploration of expression within and against the conventions of European literature. While relying primarily on the novel to represent diverse cultures and approaches to questions of identity, the course will also include essays, memoir, poetry, and film.

Black Earth,"Writing about nature-whether from the tradition of the sublime or as an expression of American potentiality or from the perspective of eco-criticism-has excluded considerations of the contributions of African-Americans. What concepts of nature and one's interaction with nature that survived the Middle Passage, the relationship of slavery, migration, and rural and urban life as well as contemporary appraisals of the environment will be among the topics considered. In particular, through literary works-whether essays, novels, or poems-environmental concerns and approaches to nature are addressed. The course proposes there is a decided and profound tradition within the African-American community of addressing nature that both parallels and is quite distinct from European traditions. Secondly, the course proposes to examine the conjunction of discrimination and environmental degradation, that the bifurcation of humans from nature is intrinsically linked to social injustice and inequality.

Giving attention to colonists and modern ideologies of othering, this course provides an overview of the history of cultural contact between Vodun religious cultures and the Western world, including representations of Vodun (Vodou, Voodoo) in newspapers, magazines, and other primary source materials. Students will examine mistranslations of Vodun peoples, materialities, philosophies, and experiences beginning with the invention of the fetish concept in the cultural contact between European merchants and African coastal communities in West Africa. We will proceed by scrutinizing the interpretation of Vodun, Vodou, and Voodoo through such categories as ""witchcraft,"" ""magic,"" and ""superstition,"" in a number of scholarly texts, We will finally conclude our semester by examining New Orleans Voodoo as not simply an African-derived religion but also as an American religious phenomenon.",AFS 240
Black Auteurs,"In this course we will analyze closely the work of five black 'auteurs,' filmmakers who by choice or necessity have written, directed and sometimes also filmed and edited their own work. Their status as auteurs has allowed them to develop a distinctive style and themes; examples of auteurs include Oscar Micheaux, Ousmane Sembene, Soulemayne Cisse, Haile Gerima, Charles Burnett, Julie Dash and of course, Spike Lee. In some instances, the label auteur refers to a long-standing collaboration between one or more individuals, such as Spike Lee and Ernest Dickerson. By analyzing more than one film from each, students will be able to trace the stylistic and thematic constants that define the work. The choice of filmmakers to feature may change each time the course is taught. (Jimenez, <em>offered occasionally</em>)",AFS 300
Sex and the City,"For women the modern city has been both a site of possibility and a site of risk. On one hand, the anonymity of the modern city has made it a space of illicit sexualities and nonconforming gender practices. At the same time, the structures and cultures of the city often inscribe normative gender and sexuality. Though readings in urban theory, social history, womens studies, geography and sociology we will explore how gender and sexuality are constitutive of and by urban form and urban like. Topics covered include prostitution, gay and lesbian sexualities, public and private space, sexual violence and race. (Belanger, <em>offered alternative years</em>)",AMST 210
Immigrant Arts: Introduction to Asian American Cultures,"This course explores the history of Asian American expressive cultures. Among the essential questions we will ask are: What different forms and sensibilities have Asian American writers and artists adopted in their work? How have these forms and sensibilities changed over time, and why? What can we discern of the relationship between culture, politics, and society? How have the experiences and representations of Asian American existence been mediated by class, gender, sexuality, and citizenship? And, Finally, how can we trace a cultural history of Asian Americans through the interpretation of novels, poetry, short stories, music, paintings, photography, sequential art, films, popular genre fiction, and cookbooks?  Students will use and interdisciplinary framework to answer these questions, combining the insights of critical race theory, cultural studies, literary scholarship, and history.",AMST 221
American Empire,"Over the course of the twentieth century, the United States came to wield increasing power over much of the globe.  This central fact of American life has defined US politics, culture, and society.  Yet many Americans know little of their country's actions abroad.  This cultivated ignorance has allowed foreign policy to be governed by a small group of elites and their specialists.  It also diminishes the realities of violence in far away places.

Digital Humanities,"The term ""digital humanities"" has a plethora of different definitions, ranging from the idea of fusing digital tools to perform traditional humanities work; studying modes of new media as objects of humanistic inquiry; and a new culture and ethos of collaboration. In this course we'll be using the tools of digital technologies to extend our inquiry into the cultural productions of the United States. Through a mix of seminar discussions, hands-on tutorials, and project-based work, this course will provide students with theoretical and practical foundations for working in the Digital Humanities, covering topics such as digitization, encoding, analysis, and visualization. The centerpiece of this class will be a digital humanities project: you will do your own original research to make an online exhibit. Creating this project will teach you the skills of humanities scholars-research, writing and analyzing, and will let you put this knowledge to work. No technical background is required.

Language and Culture,"This course introduces students to the study of language as a natural phenomenon and as a human creation. Different approaches to the analysis and study of language as a social and symbolic system are presented. Topics include the Sapir Whorf hypothesis (the idea that language determines how and what we think), the relationship between language and gender, how social forces alter the shape of language, and what language tells us about the structure of the human mind.

Early Cities,"This course deals with the manner in which humankind first came to live in cities. Early urbanism is viewed within the context of the general origins of complex society in both the Old and New Worlds. Explanatory models, such as those emphasizing population pressure and trade as causal mechanisms for the growth of cities, are reviewed. This course provides the student with a knowledge of early urban forms in different parts of the world, as well as familiarity with the methods used by archaeologists to study such phenomena.

Women and Men in Prehistory,"Until recently, much of world prehistory has been written as if only men were participants in the evolution of culture. Women for the most part have been invisible to archaeology. In the last decade, however, archaeologists have begun to focus explicitly on the issue of gender in prehistory. This course examines some of the older male-centric models, as well as some of the innovative (and controversial) new work, endeavoring to build a picture of the past in which both men and women are seen to be actors. Cases are chosen from a mix of archaeological periods and settings but currently include the controversy over the gender of the occupant of Tomb 7 at Monte Alban, Oaxaca, Mexico.

Prehistoric Ecology,"Karl Butzer has said that when we study human ecology, we look at the ""dynamic interface between environment, technology, and society."" This course takes an ecological perspective to the prehistory of humankind, finding that many events in the past can be understood more clearly when ecological analyses are undertaken. Much of the course centers on the radical shift in human relationship to the environment that took place when hunting and gathering was replaced by domestication of plants and animals. Ecologically oriented research on the trajectories of the great ancient civilizations is also studied. (Nicholas, <em>offered alternate years</em>)",ANTH 210
Love and Death in Ancient Egypt,"This course explores Egyptian paintings and reliefs from temples and tombs to reveal the strong sensual qualities encoded in the symbolism and iconography of funerary art. A careful analysis of artifacts will helps us understand how encoded images were seen as a form of power and a means to obtain immortality. While the course will provide a chronological survey of Egyptian art, it will mostly focus on the New Kingdom period because most of the tomb wall paintings to have survived belong to that specific period.

We will first define the avant-garde as an attempt to affect social change, and then look at its various manifestations including Fauvism, Dada, Cubism, German Expressionism, Russia Constructivism, Abstraction, Surrealism, New Realism, and American Abstract Expressionism. All of these avant-gardes express and define Modernism in art. We will therefore also define Modernism. Finally, we will study the potential ability of each movement to make social change.

Renaissance Women and Men,"It was once assumed that men and women enjoyed perfect equality in the Renaissance and that the beautiful representations of Venus and the Virgin Mary in Renaissance art signaled the esteem in which women were held. Recent research suggests otherwise, finding instead increasing subordination of women. This course explores this question by considering the interrelationships between images of women in Renaissance painting, social realities of womens actual lives, the phenomenon of successful women artists, church dogma about women, and the period's literature by, for, and about women.

Riding with Genghis Khan,"Genghis Khan and his descendants rode hard, fought bloody battles, envisioned world conquest, and drank copiously. They also created the largest land empire in the world, ruled over this empire effectively, and fostered cultural exchange across Eurasia at an unprecedented scale. After its fall, the empire's legacies continued to impact Eurasian history, arguable to this day. This course explores aspects of this great empire, from its Central Asian nomadic origins to the Mongol predicament after its fall. Our main focus is Genghis and the Mongol empire. Learn about the awesome Mongol battle strategies, and their administration that led to Pax Mongolica. Witness the magnificent courts and peoples that Marco Polo, or his reverse counterpart, Rabban Sauma, encountered, as you experience the excitement of their adventures. Explore how Mongols lived every day, and how they saw the world around them.

Consider why the great Khan remains widely known today, and why so many myths surround him. Let's ride through history with Genghis.",ASN 242
African American Autobiography,"The memoir or autobiography is often cast as a personal narrative; this course proposes that the memoir, and in particular the African American memoir, serves as not only the record of ones life, but also as having political agency and intention. Beginning with Harriet Jacobs <em>Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl</em>, Malcolm Xs <em>Autobiography</em> and Audre Lordes<em> Zami: A New Spelling of my Name</em>, to Barack Obamas <em>Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance</em>, the course will consider the autobiography as an argument for political and social change; as a witness to ones life, it also enacts a re-visionary process of social justice. To what degree does the structure of the slave narrative continue to inform contemporary narratives? In what ways might there be a definitive element for African American autobiographical writing? How do the community and writers interact and are interdependent? What is at stake for the African American autobiographer? (McCorkle, <em>offered occasionally</em>)",AFS 305

Harlem Goes Global: Black Politics and Culture in the 1920s,"Between World War One and World War Two, there was an explosion of artistic and literary production by African Americans.  Commonly referred to as the ""Harlem Renaissance,"" the cultural outburst  notably produced Black migrants who escaped the racial oppression of the ""Jim Crow"" South and found new freedoms in  northern cities such as New York.  But the migrations of this period were actually much more complex and widespread, involving the movement of Black artists, intellectuals, and workers across the Americas, Africa, Europe, and Asia.  This course explores the politics and culture of the global African Diaspora in this exciting period using both traditional research approaches and emerging digital humanities methods such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS).",AMST 331
"Art, Memory &amp; Cultural Power of Place","This course focuses on the public work of American Studies; the techniques, concerns and practical issues of engaged scholars. Working with city residents and community members, students will explore community cultural development. How do communities make decisions about what is worth saving, worth remember and why? How do these narratives and memories shape and transform common understandings of place? In turn, how do common understandings of place dictate the usage and extent of community control over its neighborhood? Struggles over the meaning and usage of place serve as a catalyst for conversations about how historical narrative is crafted in communities often overlooked by conventional histories. Narrations of the past help people imagine a place of their own, while cultural expression in the arts help people articulate these visions. Thus, over the course of the semester we will also examine how art gives voice to those on the margins of history, how history can infuse art with meaning and relevance, and how power of place can be used to revitalize our cities and neighborhoods. Students will also be introduced to the work of public scholars in the fields of community cultural development, historic preservations and museum studies, examine the contexts-public policy and economics-that shape the work of non-profit cultural organizations.<br>",AMST 360
NGOs and Development,"This course introduces students to critical research on NGOs in a variety of geographic contexts and invites students to consider the usefulness of approaching NGOs as discursive constellations, as arising from the interplay of international and national policy, as cultural practices, and as products of and producing globally circulating discourses of development. The course asks, what are the everyday practices constituting NGOs and development practices, and in what ways do development practices compel new types of relationships? Further, the course asks about how anthropologists study these phenomena, and how anthropological research might speak to policy concerns and issues of social justice. Prerequisites: Students must have taken ANTH 110 or declared an anthropology major or minor, international relations major or minor, sociology major, or anthropology-sociology major, or have permission of instructor.

Sex Roles,"What do ""sex,"" ""sexuality"" and ""gender"" mean, and how have anthropologists dealt with these concepts? This course will explore ethnographic approaches to sexuality and gender, and the complex relations between sexual and gendered practices, identities, and roles. We will focus our studies on ways that sex and sexuality have intersected with traditional anthropological concerns about the developmental process and rites of passage as related to kinship, family, and community. We will examine ethnographic studies, both US and non-US focused, to assess how cross-cultural studies of sexuality and gender have contributed to more complex understandings of these areas of human experience. A focus on ethnographic studies will be complemented by films and readings in other bodies of literature that have informed sexuality and gender studies.",ANTH 220
Human Rights of Indigenous People,"Throughout its history, anthropology has been committed to and active in maintaining the rights of indigenous peoples against the destructive global forces of nation-state power, racist ideologies, assimilation, and industrial resource appropriation. To develop an informed, up-to-date, and critical understanding of these issues, the course will offer an overview of the contemporary state of indigenous peoples and then guide students in pursuing on-line research of Internet sites established by indigenous peoples themselves, anthropological groups, international human rights organizations, world news services, national governments, and the United Nations.

Renaissance Women and Men,"It was once assumed that men and women enjoyed perfect equality in the Renaissance and that the beautiful representations of Venus and the Virgin Mary in Renaissance art signaled the esteem in which women were held. Recent research suggests otherwise, finding instead increasing subordination of women. This course explores this question by considering the interrelationships between images of women in Renaissance painting, social realities of women's actual lives, the phenomenon of successful women artists, church dogma about women, and the period's literature by, for, and about women. It focuses primarily, but not exclusively, on Italy in the 15th and 16th centuries. Prerequisite: one course in either art history or women's studies or permission of the instructor.

During the fabrication portion of the course, the formal aspects of design will be investigated along with its execution in stock metal (rods, sheet, plate) and ""found"" (recycled) metal. In the process of working with these materials, the class will discuss assemblage possibilities, Constructivism, and the broader context of metal as a product of industry and war as it applies Modernist and Postmodernist concerns. By contrast, in the bronze casting portion of the course, we will explore the age old process of the ""lost - wax"" method as it has been practiced continuously from the ancients to contemporary times.",ARTS 214
Courtesan Culture,"Historically, the courtesans of China or Japan have been women whose appeal lay primarily in their surpassing musical and literary cultivation, not their sexual services. This multidisciplinary course uses the textual sources and visual representations that focus on courtesan culture to examine the demimonde of the elite Chinese ""singing girl"" or the Japanese geisha across the centuries, with some attention to Western conceptions or misconceptions of their roles and relationships. The course will consider ideas about East Asian courtesans through a variety of approaches: literary, artistic, historical, religious, dramatic, and anthropological (Blanchard, <em>offered occasionally</em>)",ASN 304
Showa Through the Silver Screen,"Showa (1926-1989), the reign of Hirohito, is most often associated with Japan's plunge into multiple wars, its occupation by a foreign nation, and its economic recovery to become the second largest economy in the world. Less explored is Showa as the heyday of Japanese cinema. While motion pictures were first introduced to Japan in the late 19th century, domestic production only took off in the 1920s to the 1930s. Following the Asia-pacific Wars, Japanese film gained worldwide popularity in the 1950s and 1960s with directors such as Kurosawa Akira, Ozu Yasujiro, and Mizoguchi Kenji gaining international recognition. By the end of Showa, Japanese cinema was in decline as other forms of entertainment overshadowed movie going and a massive recession affected the film industry. This course explores the history of the Showa period using films as artifacts of Japanese perspectives into their state and society and the Japanese role in the Asia-Pacific region and the world.

Water and Energy in China,"Water and energy are at the heart of Chinas environmental challenges, and addressing those challenges (or failing to) has very real human and ecological implications now and in the future. This is so not only for the people of China, the most populous country on Earth, but also for the rest of the world: pollution from China's coal-fired power plants brings acid rain and heavy metals to the Koreas, Japan, and even the western U.S., and manufactured products (including foodstuffs) tainted with industrial toxins have made their way to store shelves around the world. Yet the roots of many of China's environmental challenges are global: just as more developed countries have outsourced many of their manufacturing activities to China, so, too, have they outsourced the pollution of water, air, soil, and bodies resulting from those activities, along with the energy and other resource demands necessary to carry them out. This course explores the challenges and opportunities of sustainability in China  from ecological, socioeconomic, and geopolitical perspectives  through a close examination of the country's water and energy resources.",ASN 340
Seminar: Chinese Literature in Translation,"This course introduces Chinese literature in both classical and modern literary traditions. Selected readings consist of translated works that encompass different literary forms and genres. Major foci are on prose, fiction, poetry, drama, and vernacular story/novel. Primary concerns are with the shifting use of literary forms and genres from one dynastic period to another, how scholars and writers in different dynasties would favor and select specific literary forms and genres to reflect on and critique political, social, and cultural issues among other things, and why religious, gender, and social class bias emerged. Change of intellectual climate, linguistic simplification, as well as literary devices such as simile, metaphor, symbolism, euphemism, and others will be explained and discussed in depth. This course is taught in English. Open to all students. Upper class Asian Studies majors/minors are highly recommended to take the course.",ASN 341

"Gender, Nation, and Literature in Latin America","This course examines the relationship between gender and national cultures in Latin America, from Independence to World War II (c. 1825-1945). As Latin American nations broke from Spanish colonial rule, state-builders confronted the colonial past and set out to forger new national identities and cultures. Specifically, state-builders sought to construct social citizenship and fashion national cultures in societies still asymmetrically ordered on the basis of the exclusionary colonial criterion of gender, ethnicity, class, and geography. Popular works of literature frequently cast the desire to reconcile the colonial order and assert modern nationalist identities in gender terms. In particular, the critical problems of state formation in Latin America-the hope and anxiety associated with post-colonial instability; socioeconomic equality, ethnic unity, and spatial consolidation; the quest for modernity; and the assertion of sovereignty and authenticity-often took on erotic overtones. Unrequited love, sexual union, and marriage became central metaphors for understanding (and naturalizing) national consolidation, and establishing the new hegemonic order. By tracing out the ""national romances"" of Latin America, we can learn much about the role of gender (writ large) in Latin American State formation, and the position of women in the region's post-colonial order. As such, this course will offer students parallel histories of the changing role of women in Latin American culture and literature, and the role of gender in the Latin American political imagination.

The Video Essay,"This course examines the video essay and its corresponding or emerging forms in videographic criticism, the essay film, and written essays, including personal narrative, creative nonfiction, or hybrid texts. Students explore source material and develop media competencies that encompass video, sound, image and text in order to critically analyze content that explores facets of identity or dimensions of culture. In addition, students collaborate on lo-fi and more developed video projects that explore the formal dimensions of narrative and criticism, By maintaining a focus on the poetic and rhetorical dimensions of the video essay, students address broader concerns in and around fair use and copyright while determining how the video essay impact them as producers  and consumers of media forms.",BIDS 390
Physical Anthropology,"Physical anthropology studies humans as biological organisms (members of the Primate Order). This course provides an overview of the three major divisions of physical anthropology: anatomical and behavioral characteristics of living non-human primates; the fossil evidence for human evolution, including discussion of the origins of culture as a major adaptive characteristic of humankind; and examination of human variability today, including a discussion of race.

Medical Anthropology,"The course explores the interconnected cultural, social, political, historical, and economic dimensions of illness, health, and healing in diverse human contexts. The first phase of the course involves study of the ways anthropologists research and understand human practices, meanings, and experiences related to illness and medical treatment in diverse socio-cultural contexts. A second facet is an inquiry into how anthropologically informed models and field methods can enhance biomedical approaches to knowing about and healing physical and mental illnesses. The third phase of the course is an in-depth critical analysis of the structural conditions that deny access to health care and vital resources to billions of people in the world today. Fourth, the course turns to appreciating the ways individuals and communities actively create meaning, purpose, and value in confronting suffering and structural violence. The course culminates with close study of the ways medical anthropologists today are actively addressing global and local public health inequities by providing adaptively emerging health care programs that can comprehensively improve the lives of individuals and contribute to long-term well-being of communities.

Passports, immigration checkpoints, neighborhood boundaries, and constructions like the Berlin Wall impact our experiences of safety and danger, belonging and alienation, delimiting and shaping our everyday experiences. This course examines anthropological engagements with these boundaries and their ongoing production, asking about experiences of crossing, the temporal shifting of borders, what happens in the space of a former walls absence, how individuals navigate conceptual borders of race, class, and sexuality, as well as the visceral boundaries that mark the edges of the contemporary nation-state. How do our everyday practices give meaning and life to borders and walls? What role do state practices of surveillance, militarization and security play in creating separations in our lives, and how can we contend with them? How are nation-states and communities constituted through the demarcation of borders and boundaries? What makes borders and walls porous for particular subjects and not others? (N.

Seminar: Comparing Ancient World Systems,"War and Peacewhich has truly characterized the world of the past? This course focuses on how ancient cultures came into contact with one another to create larger systemic networks of information exchange, trade, political interaction, and warfare. Our study is grounded in comparative world-systems theory, which modifies Wallersteins vision of a modern World-System and extends the concept to significantly earlier time periods. We will study continuity and transformation in general world-system dynamics in antiquity, paying particular attention to effects on urbanism and warfare. The course is grounded in the study of archaeological/historical cases (for example, ancient Mesopotamia), and is discussion based; student research presentations are an integral part of the course. The first half of the course will focus on some of the broader aspects of comparative world systems theory and apply those to the case of Uruk Mesopotamia (mid-4th millennium BC).

Anthropologist Jack Goody notes that cuisine like music is not hampered by language and is able to easily cross cultural barriers. So food communicates within language and can also communicate like language. Food speaks. But what does food have to say? This course explores anthropological approaches to the study of food and cuisine. In our readings and writings, we will examine the way food is produced, prepared, exchanged and given meaning in cultures around the world. Food plays an important part in identity construction, religion, and socialization, and we will explore the communicative significance of foodways in past and present societies as expressed through symbols, rituals, everyday habits, and taboos. Course readings will investigate the way that cultural ideas about gender, ethnicity, national identity, class, and social value are communicated through activities such as cooking, consuming special diets, feasting, and fasting.

This course will provide the opportunity to understand some of the cultural forces that create space, and the ways in which space becomes a social force that profoundly affects identity. This is a class that primarily examines socio-spatial relationships in the context of the United States, especially the ways in which space is used in the U. S. to designate and reinforce class, race, gender and sexuality. The course will begin with an introduction to spatial theory and spatial issues on an abstract and large-scale level as underpinnings for the more detailed examinations of these issues in architecture, landscape architecture, urban planning, community formation, and the daily activities of individuals in public and private spaces. (Makker, <em>offered alternate years</em>)",ARCH 412
Introduction to Architectural Design I: Spatial,"This course is an introduction to architectural composition emphasizing conceptual thinking. The design projects stress concept development and rigorous design process in order to create rich and evocative experiences and architectural elements. We will explore the artistic, conceptual, poetic, and experiential side of architecture as a way of developing a rigorous process of architectural form-making. This studio is about object-making at both small and large scales (book-sized to furniture-sized to house-sized) without reference to a specific site or context. This course emphasizes free-hand drawing in both pen and pencil, working in watercolor and colored pencil, and building models with clipboard and foam core. Students will learn how to sketch ideas as two-dimensional diagrams and as three-dimensional perspectives. Readings and other materials: Ching, Frank, <em>Architecture: Form, Space, Order</em>; Frederick, <em>101 Things I Learned in Architecture School</em>. Prerequisites: ARCH 110 and ART 115 and ART 125. (Makker, Blankenship, D'Angelo, <em>offered each semester</em>)",ARCS 200
Introduction to Architectural Design II: Material Craft + Poetics,"This course is an introduction to architectural composition emphasizing form making that is aesthetic, imaginative and suitable for everyday use by humans. The design projects stress craft and attention to detail, appropriateness within an architectural context, and fluidity of design concept at multiple scales (for example, a decision about texture affects decisions about massing affects decisions about siting). We will explore the material, technical, structural, and crafted qualities of architectural elements. This studio is about object-making at both small and large scales (book-sized to furniture-sized to room-sized) with reference to a specific site or context or utility. This course emphasizes drafting drawing in both pen and pencil, working in watercolor and colored pencil, and building models with chipboard and wood. Students will learn how to draw plans, sections, elevations, and three-dimensional axonometric representations. (Blankenship, Makker, D'Angelo, <em>offered each semester</em>)",ARCS 300
Visual Notes and Analysis,"A necessary part of design education is learning to observe, to document and to analyze our perceptions of architectural form and space through drawing diagrammatically rather than purely illustratively. Like a writer interprets and analyzes what they learn when they read or are lectured to, a designer uses diagrams to dissect the built works of architecture, interiors, and landscape and urban design they see in order to better understand the underlying principles that govern the physical disposition of elements, spaces, and their use. Learning to see involves both abstraction and generalization; learning to record involves understanding a conventional drawing vocabulary; learning to analyze involves understanding design principles and paradigms. We will work on location in the area, recording our visual observations only using the eye and our foot pace to measure and record spaces. No mechanical means (tape measure, ruler, camera) will be used. This course will introduce students to the habit of keeping a designer's sketchbook and to the skills used for documenting and analyzing the built environment through diagrammatic drawing in contrast to the fine arts tradition of illustrative drawing. Readings and other materials: Ching, Frank, Architecture: Form, Space, Order; Ching, Frank, Design Drawing; Cooper, Drawing and Perceiving. Prerequisites: ARCH 110 AND two of the following: ARTS 115, ARTS 114, ARTS 125 (Makker, Mathews, <em>offered alternate years</em>)",ARCS 303
Advanced Architecture Studio,"This advanced studio design course offers students an opportunity to engage in a design project at an upper level, both in terms of skills/abilities and intellectually in terms of tackling complex circumstances, site or program constraints or questions. The physical site may be in an urban, exurban, rural or small town context where the design project must participate in a wide matrix of formal, cultural and environmental references. Research, through analysis of precedent, site investigation, critical readings and exploration of technique, is considered a creative activity, driven by hypothesis and providing the base for much of the production in the studio. Prerequisites: Two ARCS studios at the 200 or 300-level; architectural, art, or landscape history courses; or permission of the instructor. (Makker, Blankenship, D'Angelo, Spring, <em>offered occasionally</em>)",ARCS 400
Senior Seminar: Architectural Portfolio,"The Architectural Portfolio course provides senior Architecture Studies majors with capstone experience. At the end of this course, each student will have a professional quality graphic record of their design work at the Colleges in the form of a graphic narrative of their creative process. Students learn the special techniques of photographing architectural drawings and models, how to use Adobe Photoshop and how to manipulate, edit, and correct digital images. The course then explores graphic design and how to present a graphic narrative of design. Finally, students will learn the fine points of professional printing and binding. By the end of the course, students will have a high-quality portfolio, essential for admission to any graduate architecture program. Prerequisites: Must be a senior Architectural Studies Major. (S. Mathews, Makker, Blankenship, D'Angelo, <em>offered annually</em>)",ARCS 405
Visual Anthropology,"Culture is manifested in visual symbols embedded in gestures, ceremonies, ritual performances, and artifacts. In this course students will explore the history and development of anthropology's relationship to visual practices, focusing on, but not limited to, photography and film, both as a mode for representing culture and as a site of cultural practice. Our central goal will be to move away from concepts of objectivity or subjectivity toward the use of deeply situated spaces to investigate the making of reality. Critical theory, methods, and ethical concerns are all part of the current refashioning of visual anthropology and as such will be critical components of the class. Prerequisite: Students must have declared an anthropology major or minor, sociology major, or anthropology-sociology major, or have permission of instructor.

Internship adviser permission is required to take this course, and prior departmental approval is required for any students who wish to repeat ANTH 499. Permission of the instructor.",ANTH 499
Introduction to Sociology,"An introduction to the fundamental concepts of sociology, this course focuses on such central issues as the social nature of personality; the effects of social class, race, and gender on social life; the interactional basis of society; and the place of beliefs and values in social structure and social action. A fundamental concern is to analyze the reciprocal nature of social existence to understand how society influences us and how we, in turn, construct it. Typically, the course applies the sociological perspective to an analysis of American society and other social systems. (Freeman, Harris, Kosta, Monson, Perkins, Sutton, <em>offered every semester</em>) Note: All upper level sociology courses require SOC 100 as a prerequisite.",SOC 100
Kids and Contention,"This class tackles the contentious history of childhood and youth in the U.S. context from a sociological perspective. We'll explore the history of childhood and youth, paying close attention to the ways in which young people are able to impact their social environment. Childhood is a social category that has historically been constructed by policies that fulfill the needs of adults. This course will provide us with a context to understand and interpret those policies and also investigate how children respond. We'll also examine how policy and other institutions inform particular norms, values, and stereotypes of young people, sometimes regardless of data or input from the young people themselves. Throughout the semester, we'll evaluate the role(s) of children in the various institutions, including schools, families, courts, neighborhoods, peer groups, and as consumers. Prerequisite: SOC 100. (Freeman, <em>offered annually</em>)",SOC 206
Research Methods,"This course is an introduction to the basic issues and fundamental trends of social research. The logic of inquiry, research design, sampling, validity, reliability of indicators in social data, and logistical and ethical problems in the collection and analysis of data form the central problems for consideration. Techniques of data collection, such as, participant observation, content analysis, experimental design, unobtrusive measures, and survey research are discussed. The course is intended to prepare students for original research efforts and also to help them become more sophisticated consumers of the literature of the social sciences today. Prerequisite: SOC 100. (Monson, Sutton, <em>offered every semester</em>)",SOC 211
Data Analysis,"This course provides an introduction to the organization and analysis of data in the process of social research. Presentation of data in tabular and graphic forms, the use of elementary descriptive and inferential statistics, and the use of bivariate and multivariate analytic procedures in the analysis of data are examined. This course includes a laboratory experience in the use of computing software to display data and test hypotheses. The course is ultimately intended to prepare students for original research efforts and to help them become more sophisticated consumers of the literature of the social sciences today. Prerequisite: SOC 100. (Perkins, Freeman, <em>offered annually</em>)",SOC 212
Social Psychology,"In this seminar course, major theoretical perspectives and classic empirical studies in social psychology are introduced. The emphasis is on exposure to a variety of viewpoints in the literature. Theoretical orientations, such as learning theory, exchange theory, role theory, symbolic interaction, attribution theory, and cognitive balance models are surveyed during the term. Furthermore, studies in substantive areas, such as social norms and behavioral conformity, attitude change, interpersonal attraction, group dynamics, conflict and cooperation, and leadership are examined in light of these major perspectives. The course gives attention to the congruencies and disparities among psychological and sociological perspectives within the interdisciplinary field of social psychology. Prerequisite: SOC 100. (Perkins, <em>offered alternate years</em>)",SOC 220
Aesthetics,"This course addresses a variety of philosophical issues relating to the arts, focusing on questions such as these: What is the nature of artistic creativity? What is the purpose of the arts? Is there a way for us to determine aesthetic value? Is there truth in art? How are emotions related to the arts? What role should art critics play? How are interpretations and evaluations of art influenced by factors such as culture, time period, race, gender, class? What role do the arts have in non-Western cultures? Are there aesthetic experiences outside of the arts? The course concludes by examining specific art forms chosen according to student interests. (Oberbrunner, <em>offered annually</em>)",PHIL 230
Social Deviance,"This course explores the social etiology of deviant behavior, the functions of deviance, and societal reactions to deviance. An interdisciplinary approach is taken to the internalization of norms, guilt, shame, punishment, and conformity as they relate to deviance. Various theoretical approaches are examined. Social deviance is considered as a regular aspect of societies, and this course is directed toward a normative theory of culture, addressed to the problems of order, conflict, and change. Prerequisite: SOC 100. (Harris, Sutton, <em>offered annually</em>)",SOC 224
Working Families,"What is a ""working family?"" What work is done by families? When do families work well, and who or what makes these judgments? The family is analyzed as a social institution embedded in particular historical contexts, one which reflects broad economic change, cultural shifts, and political movements. Particular attention is paid to how various axes of social inequality (gender, class, race, and sexuality) shape the experience of family life at the individual level, and the evaluation of various family forms at the societal level. The questions we consider include: How are families affected by the institution of paid work, and how do workplaces respond (or not) to shifting family configurations? Are two-parent, single-parent, or extended families more common historically and cross-culturally? What social forces contribute to divorce rates? What are the causes and consequences of male-breadwinner and dual-earner families? How have cultural norms concerning motherhood and fatherhood changed over time? Prerequisite: SOC 100. (Monson, <em>offered annually</em>)",SOC 225
Sex and Gender,"What is the connection between biological sex and our identities as men and women? How is the variation over time and across cultures in gendered behavior explained? What are the sources and consequences of differences between women and men? How are these differences linked to inequalities of race and class as well as gender? What social forces will alter gender relations in the future? This course provides an introduction to sociological perspectives on gender relations as a social structure. Several theoretical frameworks for understanding the sources and persistence of gender differences and inequality are considered. Students examine a range of social institutions and ideological constructs shaping the social structure of gender, such as the state, family, employment, sexuality, and reproduction. Prerequisite: SOC 100. (Monson, <em>offered alternate years</em>)",SOC 226
Immigrant America,"Ethnicity and race are constantly evolving social constructions, yet they remain among the most persistent forms of structured social inequality. Focusing on the United States, but with reference to other multi-ethnic societies, this course will consider the immigration histories to examine why and how the salience of ethnic identity increases and decreases at particular historical moments, how the categories of race and ethnicity inform each other, and how they are inexorably related to the continuous remaking of the American mainstream. This course will pay particular attention to the immigration patterns of the turn-of the-twentieth-century (Ellis Island) groups, and the Chicago-school tradition of urban ethnographies that documented the lives of those groups during the 20th and 21st centuries. (Kosta, <em>offered alternate years</em>)",SOC 238
Sociology of Business and Management,"This course provides an ""applied"" sociological analysis of the major trends shaping business in the United States and worldwide. Students explore the nature of business organization and management, at the micro level in its institutional forms and the business and management environment, at the macro level as it operates within economic and cultural systems, and within global contexts. The issues of demographic effects, ethical concerns, technological innovation, the role of producers and consumers, and the changing role of government are considered. Prerequisite: SOC 100. (Harris, <em>offered alternate years</em>)",SOC 242
Religion in American Society,"This course focuses upon religion in American society from the post World War II era to the present, using sociological theory and empirical research to form the basic analytical perspective. A survey of the major religious traditions is provided along with an introduction to contemporary cults, sects, and new religious movements. Topics such as civil religion, processes of secularization and revival, social and demographic influences on belief and practice, organizational structures, church and state relations, and political activism of religious groups are examined. Discussion concerning the theological, ethical, and political implications of sociological claims about religion is also encouraged. Prerequisite: SOC 100. (Perkins, <em>offered alternate years</em>)",SOC 244
Global Cities,"Everywhere, in numbers unheard of before, people are flocking to the world's cities, in many cases, regardless of the fact that when they arrive there, they find living conditions awful or even worse. Why? What do people want from cities? This course seeks to answer these questions by exploring the overarching concept of ""the global city"" developed in the aftermath of the restructuring of the world economy since the mid-1970s. It will examine the historical emergence of global cities (ne ""world cities""), and critically assess this conceptualization as a paradigm, theory, and research agenda within urban studies. We start with an overview of urbanization processes in the U.S. from the 19th century onwards, introduce the central body of theoretical literature on global cities, and continue exploring thematic topics such as new forms of inequality, labor relationships, neighborhood dynamics, and forms of fragmentation and segregation, through a comparative focus of urban processes around the world. A central feature of this course is the exploration of 21st century urbanism in the non-Western world. Prerequisite: SOC 100. (Kosta, <em>offered alternate years</em>)",SOC 253
Social Problems in Ireland,"The focus of this course is the examination of fundamental social problems confronting contemporary Western societies. How social problems have emerged or have been perpetuated in recent years, and how social problems are defined and perceived by particular social groups, are important issues for this course, as is the consideration of various types of attempts to address these problems. In particular, the course poses the following questions: In what ways does a focused look at Ireland reveal particularly distinctive problems or essentially mirror larger patterns of problems facing most modern Western nations? And to what extent do the social problems reflect distinct or overlapping issues confronting the peace and stability of local communities and the nation of Ireland as a whole? What are the sources or causes of a social problem and what are the local and national programs and policies that emerge in attempts to address them, and how effective are these interventions?

Social Problems,"The focus of this course is the examination of fundamental social problems confronting contemporary American society. How social problems have emerged or have been perpetuated in recent years, and how social problems are defined and perceived by particular social groups are important issues for this course, as is the analysis of possible solutions to these problems. Poverty, racism, care of the aged, alcohol and substance abuse, the AIDS epidemic, pornography, juvenile delinquency, prostitution, family violence, abortion, children's rights, church and state conflicts, gun control, and capital punishment are some examples of topics for this course. Prerequisite: SOC 100. (Staff, <em>offered occasionally</em>)",SOC 258
Juvenile Delinquency,"This course outlines the history of juvenile delinquency in the United States and highlights current trends and patterns of delinquent behavior. A number of explanations have been proposed for why young people engage in deviance and crime, and a range of responses have been developed to identify, rehabilitate, and at times punish juveniles who do not behave appropriately. This course provides an in-depth look into these explanations and responses, and it critically examines how social power, inequalities, gender, poverty, and other sociological themes are intertwined with juvenile offending and the social control of juvenile delinquents. A sample of substantive topics focused on in this course includes gangs, juvenile sex offenders, substance abuse, violence, and the juvenile justice system. (Sutton, <em>offered annually</em>) ",SOC 263
Classical Sociological Theory,"The founders of sociology were deeply concerned about problems that continue to be of vital importance for contemporary sociological inquiry. Questions such as the nature of society and its relationship to individuals, the relation between sociological theory and social practice, whether sociology is a science and, if not, what it is, and so on, are all absolutely central to the sociological enterprise, and yet often become lost. This course returns to the classics in an effort to uncover the questions sociologists need constantly to ask themselves if they wish to reflect cogently upon their role in the contemporary world. Required of all sociology majors. Prerequisite: SOC 100. (Harris, Kosta, <em>offered annually</em>)",SOC 300
Race and Education,"This course provides an in-depth analysis of the ways in which education in the United States, at times challenges and at times reproduces racial hierarchy. Using a combination of macro and micro level sociological theories (e.g., structural functionalism, social reproduction, intersectionality, interactional), we'll explore the socialization, organization, and assessment practices of schooling in the United States with a lens toward racial inequality. Education is often touted as the key to equality, particularly in the U.S. context. This course explores how education, despite this idealized view, has reproduced, and in some cases, exacerbated existing social inequalities. Using both micro and macro sociological frameworks, we will engage several key works that establish how schools create a social order that is not egalitarian and, how, in fact, schools were never intended to promote equality across demographic groups. We will also explore reforms and alternatives to promote racial equality through schooling. Discussions of primary texts will not only engage sociological theory but will also analyze methodological choice and relevance for questions of educational equality. (Freeman, <em>offered alternate years</em>)",SOC 357
Criminology,"This course provides a comprehensive overview of criminological theory and its applications. The major theories of crime and criminal behavior are presented, crime trends and patterns are investigated, and the main sources of crime data are critically assessed. Substantive crime topics such as fear of crime, victimization, drug use, murder, burglary, white-collar deviance, and sexual assault are also examined. Although interdisciplinary approaches to understanding crime will be explored given that the field of criminology in inherently interdisciplinary, this course is ultimately grounded in broader sociological principles and concepts, including but not limited to race, gender, class, power, social inequality, socialization, and social interaction. Discussions of course topics will be theoretical and empirical, with special attention given to the roles that data and research play in the evaluation of theory and the development of evidence based practices for responding to crime. (Sutton, <em>offered alternate years</em>)",SOC 362
"Religion, Politics, and Lifestyle","Sociological theory has long debated the role of religious belief and practice in the maintenance and transformation of society. Does what is sacred essentially maintain the social patterns and power structure of society or do various forms of belief and spirituality make a crucial contribution to movements producing social change? Has religion become a less important element of society in the modern world through growing secularization or is it continually transformed with renewed social influence in society? These questions about the effects and prevalence of sacred beliefs and institutions are examined through the views of both classic and contemporary sociologists. This advanced seminar course examines variation in the social significance of religion by looking at how alternative movements as well as dominant beliefs and practices in modern Western societies have remained influential, faded to marginality, or reemerged in political and social life. Three debates will be highlighted: the problem of pluralism spawning religious conflict, the question of the inevitability of secularization, and the possibility of imposing a separation between religion and the modern political state. (Perkins, <em>offered alternate years</em>)",SOC 370
Social Policy,"This course focuses on U.S. income support policies designed to address poverty due to old age, unemployment, and single parenthood, using case studies of other Western welfare states for comparative purposes. The course traces the historical development and restructuring of the U.S. welfare state, from the ""poor laws"" in the colonial era, through the New Deal of the 1930s, the War on Poverty in the 1960s and 1970s, and the ""end of welfare"" at the turn of the 21st century. Central questions considered include how families, labor markets, and states intersect, and whether welfare states' policies ameliorate or reinforce inequalities of gender, race, and class.

Pro Present,"(1/2 credit) This class equips students with a toolkit to finalize independent research and present it professionally at an academic conference. Seniors who are pursuing honors projects, advanced independent studies, or furthering research projects initiated in Research Methods are invited to apply to the instructor for admission. Students will learn how to critique sociological work, strengthen their own arguments, build a professional verbal and visual presentation, field questions from those outside of their area of expertise, and present their work confidently and coherently. This course culminates in a required professional poster presentation at the Eastern Sociological Society annual meeting (or a comparable professional sociological conference) in spring of the same year.
